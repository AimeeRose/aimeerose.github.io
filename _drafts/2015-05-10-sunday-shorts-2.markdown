This Sunday Short is dedicated to sports. I have a newly discovered passion for sports, and I attribute it to two factors:

* My belated discovery of Nate Silver and [fivethirtyeight.com's](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) podcast [The Hot Takedown](http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/hot-takedown/) dedicated to sports analysis by the numbers (and its hosts' thoughtful insights).
* Previously, the pace of sports and absence of a story line left me bored and disinterested. However, not dissimilar to how I became to discover a love for olives, seemingly overnight these detractors became qualities. More concretely, I have found a love for the design, history and athleticism present in today's (english) football and baseball.

## [1. The Hot Takedown's analysis of Pacquiao vs Mayweather](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/podcast-boring-boxing-nba-round-2-why-the-world-needs-a-new-baseball-stat/)

The Hot Takedown's show this week features a discussion of the momentous match. I didn't watch the match, but their analysis was excellent. Just looking at the numbers, it seems unavoidable that Mayweather was the champion: his landed punches percentage was 34 to Pacquiao's 19. However, the hosts actually watched the match and described how Mayweather's punches didn't carry much heat. This explains how Pacquiao could have thought (or at least pretended to have thought) he had won.

## [2. The84Draft NBA Documentary](http://www.nba.com/2014/news/05/27/nbatv-to-feature-84-draft.ap/)

On a long trans-atlantic flight I got the opportunity to watch The84Draft Documentary, produced by NBA TV. The 1984 draft included hall of famers Akim Olajuwon, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, John Stockton and Oscar Schmidt. I personally had never heard of the last two and loved their stories:

* Stockton holds the NBA record for assists, 15,806, 3,000 more than the next best ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stockton#NBA_career)). 
* Schmidt, from Brazil, never actually played in the NBA. He was drafted several times and declined in order to continue playing for the National team. Brazil beat the US All-Star team in the 1987 Pan American Games, which he says is the highlight of his career.

That's all for this week. Thanks for stopping by!
