Annual U.S Domestic Average Itinerary Fare in Current and Constant Dollars,,,,,,"Fares based on domestic itinerary fares. Itinerary fares consist of round-trip fares unless the customer does not purchase a return trip. In that case, the one-way fare is included. Fares are based on the total ticket value which consists of the price charged by the airlines plus any additional taxes and fees levied by an outside entity at the time of purchase. Fares include only the price paid at the time of the ticket purchase and do not include other fees paid at the airport or onboard the aircraft. Averages do not include frequent-flyer or “zero fares” or a few abnormally high reported fares.",,,,,,Year,2014 constant dollars average,2014 constant dollars percent change,2014 constant dollars cummulative % from 1995,Current dollars,Current dollars percent change,Cummulative % change from 19951995,454,,,292,,1996,418,-7.9,-7.9,277,-5.3,-5.31997,424,1.4,-6.7,287,3.8,-1.71998,450,6.2,-0.9,309,7.6,5.81999,461,2.4,1.5,324,4.7,10.82000,467,1.3,2.9,339,4.7,162001,429,-8.2,-5.6,321,-5.4,9.72002,411,-4.1,-9.4,312,-2.6,6.92003,406,-1.3,-10.6,315,1,7.92004,383,-5.7,-15.7,305,-3.2,4.52005,373,-2.7,-17.9,307,0.6,5.22006,386,3.6,-15,329,6.9,12.42007,372,-3.6,-18.1,325,-1,11.32008,381,2.4,-16.1,346,6.5,18.52009,343,-10.1,-24.5,310,-10.4,6.22010,365,6.5,-19.6,336,8.3,152011,383,4.9,-15.6,364,8.3,24.52012,387,0.9,-14.9,375,3,28.32013,389,0.6,-14.3,382,1.9,30.72014(thru Q3),391,0.5,-13.9,391,2.4,33.8SOURCE: Bureau of Transportation Statistics,,,,,,* Rate calculated using Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index.,,,,,,Note: Percent change based on unrounded numbers,,,,,,
