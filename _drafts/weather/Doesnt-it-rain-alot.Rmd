Stream of Consciousness

"Where are you from?"

"Seattle. I miss it, I love it there. It's beautiful!"

...

"Doesn't it rain a lot in Seattle?"

Well, let's find out. 

I've always been under the impression both from personal experience and from something factual I read once that the real amount of preciptation in Seattle is actually not as high as some east coast cities (cough::NewYork::cough).

## Exploring the data

First I had to find historical data, because inevitably I'm going to want to know if this has ALWAYS been true or have things been changing due to climate change.

But, let's start with the simple question of what's been happening in 2014.

```{r}
library(RCurl)
downloadURL  = "ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt"
download.file(downloadURL, 'ghcnd-stations.txt')
stations <- read.delim('ghcnd-stations.txt', sep = '\n')

```
