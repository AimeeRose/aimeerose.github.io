Just when I was getting ready to build a blog while simultaneously exercising my [AngularJS][angularjs] skills, I found [github pages][github-pages]. I knew about github pages, but I didn't know how dead-simple it is to set up. Sometimes the brillance of the internet mucks with the fun of being a developer. I keep in mind, at these times, the words of Alfred North Whitehead:

>  Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.


I was excited about AngularJS, after finally learning the basics from [this awesome codeschool course][angular-codeschool]. But! I am sure I will find an opportunity to use AngularJS in the not-so-distant future.

This post is pretty much just a commercial for github pages, so [here is the link to github pages help site][github-pages-help] and [the link to the github pages site again][github-pages].

Github pages is powered by [Jekyll][jekyll] to boot, which includes markdown for code, an essential feature of any developer's blogging platform.

{% highlight javascript %}
(function() {
  alert('allthethings!');
}());
{% endhighlight %}
