Thank you github for making blogging fun and easy! Just when I was preparing to build a blog with Angular.js, I found the github pages site. I'm a little annoyed because I was excited about Angular.js, after finally learning the basics from [this awesome codeschool course][angular-codeschool]. But! I am sure I will find an opportunity in the not-so-distant future.

This post is pretty much already just a commercial for github pages, so [here is a link to github pages instructional site][github-pages].

Github pages uses [Jekyll][jekyll], which is perfect because Jekyll offers support for code snippet markdown.

{% highlight javascript %}
(function() {
  alert('Hello World!');
}());
{% endhighlight %}
