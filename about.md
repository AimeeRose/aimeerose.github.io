Welcome!
<br/>
<br/>
My name is Aimee and this is my blog. I post explorations into data and topics which interest me.
<br/>
<br/>
By day, I am a software engineer at a company producing software for clinical trials.
<br/>
<br/>
I live in Jersey City and here is a short list of things I enjoy in no particular order: long walks, craft beer, skiing, podcasts, black coffee, and documentary films.
<br/>
