[{"id":"61KVlP","name":"C.H. Evans Brewing Company","description":"The Evans family was in the commercial brewing business for three generations. The original brewery was built in Hudson, NY in 1786. It continued production until prohibition in 1920. Its award winning ales were well known in the Northeast and were even exported to England and France. Production levels peaked in 1915 when 65,000 barrels of beer were produced at the Hudson Facility.\r\n\r\nThe brewery bottled its own beer in Hudson at one of the countryâ€™s earliest bottling facilities (1889) and later at a plant in New York City. The family also malted much of their own grain in their malt houses at the Hudson facility. Neil Evans revives this rich heritage here at the Albany Pump Station. Surviving C.H. Evans Brewing Company memorabilia is displayed in the new facility, as well as pictures of the pump station as it appeared at the turn of the century.","website":"http://www.evansbrewing.com/","established":"1786","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/61KVlP/upload_nAkwyi-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/61KVlP/upload_nAkwyi-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/61KVlP/upload_nAkwyi-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2013-08-13 12:47:13","locations":[{"id":"oMNpgF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"19 Quackenbush Square","locality":"Albany","region":"New York","postalCode":"12207","phone":"518-447-9000","website":"http://www.evansale.com/","latitude":42.654201,"longitude":-73.748065,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1786","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
