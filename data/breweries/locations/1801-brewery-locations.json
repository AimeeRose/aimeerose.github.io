The first hops were grown in 1004 and the brewing followed shortly. The combination of the dark red soil, rich in ferrous oxide (which retains water) and climate allows the region to produce the award winning crop.\r\nThe Zatec brewery - built in 1801 - is situated inside the Zatec castle walls, overlooking the town and hop fields.\r\nThe brewery suffered for lack of investment during the Communist years until by 2000 the brew was hardly available even locally, much to the detriment of the Zatec economy. In year 2001 Rolf Munding purchased the brewery from a local business man and began a program of investment which has rejuvenated the brewery and improved the prospects for the beer, brewery and the people of Zatec, both as beer drinkers and brewers.\r\nTomas Lejsek, one of Czech Republic’s leading and most innovative brew masters has masterminded the changes, bringing together new technology, old brewing processes and pure ingredients.","website":"http://www.zatec-brewery.com/","established":"1801","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ABR6Y1/upload_bl1fXS-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ABR6Y1/upload_bl1fXS-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ABR6Y1/upload_bl1fXS-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-31 11:30:08","updateDate":"2012-10-31 11:30:08","locations":[{"id":"GOh8Oi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Žatecký pivovar, spol. s r.o., Žižkovo náměstí 81,","region":"Žatec","postalCode":"438 01","phone":"+420 415 710 783","website":"http://www.zatec-brewery.com/","latitude":50.313918,"longitude":13.534263,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-31 11:31:40","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CZ","name":"CZECH REPUBLIC","displayName":"Czech Republic","isoThree":"CZE","numberCode":203,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
