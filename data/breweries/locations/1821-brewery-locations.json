[{"id":"ZZs87j","name":"Brasserie Fischer","description":"The Fischer brewery was founded in 1821 in Strasbourg, in the Alsace region in France, and moved to Schiltigheim in 1854, apparently because of the good quality of water there. In 1922, they took over the neighbouring Adelshoffen brewery and became Groupe Pêcheur (the French translation of the German Fischer). Groupe Pêcheur was in turn taken over by Heineken in 1996.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Heineken announced that it would close the brewery by the end of 2009 and transfer its production to the l'Espérance (en: hope) brewery, also in Schiltigheim.","website":"http://www.brasseriefischer.com/","established":"1821","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ZZs87j/upload_IjP8Dh-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ZZs87j/upload_IjP8Dh-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ZZs87j/upload_IjP8Dh-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-10-08 17:31:43","locations":[{"id":"jSwodP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7, route de Bischwiller","region":"Schiltigheim","postalCode":"67300","phone":"+33 (0)3 88 33 82 00","website":"http://www.brasseriefischer.com/","latitude":48.6114971,"longitude":7.7510832,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"FR","yearOpened":"1821","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"FR","name":"FRANCE","displayName":"France","isoThree":"FRA","numberCode":250,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"qZJOHj","name":"Brouwerij Rodenbach","description":"In 1821, the four Rodenbach brothers (Pedro, Alexander, Ferdinand and Constantijn) invested in a small brewery in Roeselare, in the West Flanders province of Belgium. The brothers agreed to a partnership for 15 years. At the end of this period, Pedro and his wife, Regina Wauters, bought the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served in the military. Their son Edward later took over the brewery (1864) and, it was during his directorship that the brewery saw great growth. Edward's son, Eugene, took over in 1878 and, in preparation for this position, travelled to England where he learned how to ripen beer in oak barrels and then mix old and young beers. It was this that became the method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for. As Eugene produced no male offspring, a public limited liability corporation was created and most shares remained in the hands of descendants of the Rodenbach's until 1998 when the brewery was sold to Palm Brewery.","website":"http://www.rodenbach.be/","established":"1821","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qZJOHj/upload_GuFeW1-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qZJOHj/upload_GuFeW1-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qZJOHj/upload_GuFeW1-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:05","locations":[{"id":"jH1IY7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Spanjestraat 133-141","locality":"Roeselare","region":"West-Vlaanderen","phone":"32-051-27-28-10","website":"http://www.rodenbach.be/","latitude":50.9460157,"longitude":3.1375433,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"1821","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
