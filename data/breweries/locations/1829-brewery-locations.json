Yuengling and Son","description":"D.G. Yuengling & Son is the oldest operating brewing company in the United States, having been established in 1829, and is one of the largest breweries by volume in the country. It is the second largest American owned brewery after the Boston Beer Company. Its headquarters is in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nYuengling produces 3.6 million barrels annually, which as of 2005, placed it sixth among American commercial breweries. Besides its two Pennsylvania facilities, Yuengling also operates a brewery in Tampa, Florida.\r\n\r\nThe family-owned brewery has traditionally changed ownership through the purchase of the company by the offspring of the previous owner. Due to the popularity of Yuengling Traditional Lager in Pennsylvania, it can be ordered by simply asking for a lager, especially in eastern parts of the state.","website":"http://www.yuengling.com","established":"1829","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pX8lES/upload_VJc4cc-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pX8lES/upload_VJc4cc-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pX8lES/upload_VJc4cc-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2012-10-22 13:38:55","locations":[{"id":"mLNnA3","name":"Pottsville","streetAddress":"310 Mill Creek Avenue","locality":"Pottsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17901","phone":"570-622-0153","website":"http://www.yuengling.com","hoursOfOperation":"Monday thru Friday\r\n9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.\r\n \r\nSaturday\r\nApril thru December Only\r\n10:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.","latitude":40.6999592,"longitude":-76.1747169,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"BVG7Ls","name":"Tampa","streetAddress":"11111 N 30th St","locality":"Tampa","region":"Florida","postalCode":"33612","hoursOfOperation":"Monday thru Friday\r\n9:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.\r\n \r\nSaturday\r\n10:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m.","latitude":28.049125,"longitude":-82.426171,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-07 12:14:22","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
