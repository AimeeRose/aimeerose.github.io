The brewery and its beers are usually referred to as Westvleteren. The brewery's three beers have acquired an international reputation for taste and quality, being considered by a percentage of beer aficionados and judges to be \"the best beer in the world\" (for Wesvleteren XII, a Quadrupel) as well as the limited availability of the beers which are not brewed to normal commercial demands, but are sold in small quantities weekly from the doors of the monastery itself, to individual buyers after reservation only.","website":"http://www.sintsixtus.be/","established":"1831","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-01-24 11:35:52","locations":[{"id":"iSRnNJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Donkerstraat 12","locality":"Westvleteren","region":"West-Vlaanderen","phone":"32-057-40-10-57","latitude":50.8971245,"longitude":2.7242372,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
