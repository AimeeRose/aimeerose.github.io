[{"id":"AKyyYN","name":"Pabst Brewing Company","description":"At Pabst Brewing Company, we make beer with history, with a sense of place. From Milwaukee to Motown, through the Pacific Northwest and back East again, our brands are like family and hometown friends. And we should know a little something about regional pride: Since we started in 1844, we've welcomed 24 new states into the Union. Today, Pabst crafts over 25 classic brews with strict adherence to original standards of quality. Our brands rack up national and international festival awards. Most important, they continue to make memories in the places that mean a lot to our consumers.","website":"http://www.pabst.com/","established":"1844","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/AKyyYN/upload_zUKMjt-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/AKyyYN/upload_zUKMjt-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/AKyyYN/upload_zUKMjt-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-13 11:39:31","locations":[{"id":"ct1Zeb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"PO Box 1661","locality":"San Antonio","region":"Texas","postalCode":"78296","phone":"1-800-935-2337","website":"http://www.pabst.com/","latitude":29.4497864,"longitude":-98.5386319,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1844","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"WvkJlJ","name":"Privatbrauerei Specht","website":"http://www.privatbrauerei-specht.de/","established":"1844","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:20:11","updateDate":"2012-08-12 23:52:27","locations":[{"id":"F20glD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Thomas-Mann-Stra√üe 17","locality":"Ehrenfriedersdorf","region":"Sachsen","postalCode":"09427","latitude":50.64608,"longitude":12.96634,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:47:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
