The Beer That Made Milwaukee Jealous!\r\n\r\nIn the Lithia Beer spirit and tradition, Lithia is based not only on the finest natural, quality ingredients and processes, but also on extremely pure, hand-crafted, mineral-containing water. West Bend Lithia Beer  is a serious beer drinker’s beer, not a chemically concocted, watered down, commodity beer...it’s simply more beer and less water. Lithia Beer contains no corn or rice grains. \r\n\r\nOnly the finest hops, and slow roasted, as well as other malts, are utilized. A true pre-Prohibition brew. Lithia Beer is serious beer for serious beer drinkers.\r\n\r\n“A great beer that’s \r\ngreat for the community too” ™\r\n\r\nRecreating the Lithia Beer line, as with all good brews, will be a work in progress. Our first brew, Regner Red, a great Rich, Crisp & Creamy Style Red Ale, a very smooth, drinkable brew, was developed in the great spirit of Lithia beer of the past before prohibition. Popular tastes in beer have changed and matured, as have the brewing process and ingredients. We have chosen to develop extremely high quality, natural beers that will be popular with the sophisticated customers of our time and in our community. We utilized the same process to roll out other Lithia Premium Beers such as Bucky Blonde Ale, arguably the most complex, richest blonde beer ever brewed.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, Lithia Beer will again, and exclusively, be based in West Bend & Washington County, where it belongs. It’s heritage will now continue to benefit our community for hopefully, the next hundred years. A portion of Lithia Beer proceeds are donated to The Museum of Wisconsin Art, The Washington County Historical & Humane\r\nSociety’s, and rebuilding Regner Park plus many other area charities.","website":"http://www.lithiabeer.com/","established":"1848","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nkvfdC/upload_9BekAo-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nkvfdC/upload_9BekAo-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nkvfdC/upload_9BekAo-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:12","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:14","locations":[{"id":"0jYfnH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"825 Schoenhaar Drive","locality":"West Bend","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53090","phone":"877-927-6367","website":"http://www.lithiabeer.com/","hoursOfOperation":"8 am - 4 pm Monday thru Thursday\r\n8 am - 3 pm Friday","latitude":43.4313442,"longitude":-88.1578439,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1848","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:12","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
