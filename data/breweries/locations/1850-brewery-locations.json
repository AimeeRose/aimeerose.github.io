[{"id":"5kOAIa","name":"Almar Orchards","description":"This Original Hard-Cider has been made on our family-owned farm in Flushing, Michigan for well over a hundred years. It was first pressed back in the 1850's. Not much as changed in the process since then. We use the same apples from the same orchards as my great-great grandfather did before the time of the Civil War. We are proud of that. It gives us a sense of history.\r\n\r\nThe cider has played an important role in the ongoing history of our farm. The sale of cider actually saved our farm during the Great Depression. And, during the Prohibition people came from far and wide for our \"Special Farm Cider.\"","website":"http://www.almarorchards.com/","established":"1850","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-30 20:30:57","updateDate":"2014-10-08 16:57:36","locations":[{"id":"Osvyj0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1431 Duffield Rd","locality":"Flushing","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48433","latitude":43.027413,"longitude":-83.913387,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-08 17:04:24","updateDate":"2014-10-08 17:04:24","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"mt0ws2","name":"Freiberger Brauhaus","website":"http://www.freiberger-bier.de/","established":"1850","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:20:03","updateDate":"2012-08-12 23:59:22","locations":[{"id":"i6yPHf","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Am Fürstenwald","locality":"Freiberg","region":"Saxony","postalCode":"09599","latitude":50.916199,"longitude":13.335215,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 23:59:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"fjmwO4","name":"Privatbrauerei Lasser","website":"http://www.lasser.de/","established":"1850","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:16:30","updateDate":"2012-08-12 22:55:45","locations":[{"id":"dimtrs","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Belchenstraße 5","locality":"Lörrach","region":"Baden-Württemberg","postalCode":"79539","latitude":33.36681,"longitude":-99.864139,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:45:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"uV6ou7","name":"Stroh Brewery Company","description":"A name as important to the success of Detroit as Ford or Chrysler, the Stroh family began with humble roots, brewing beer in a family-owned inn during the 18th century in Kirn, Germany. In 1848, during the German Revolution, Bernhard Stroh, having apprenticed at his father side, immigrated to the United States. He established his own brewery in Detroit in 1850. Stroh named his new company Lion's Head Brewery, adopting the Lion's Crest logo from the Kyrburg Castle in Germany – the same crest that adorns Stroh beers today\r\n\r\nAfter establishing the brewery, Bernhard's son, Bernhard Jr., continued its expansion. A firm proponent of tradition and quality, he introduced the European method of fire-brewing to America. The fire-brewing process uses a direct flame rather than steam to heat beer-filled copper kettles. The resulting higher temperatures intensify the aroma and body of beer, resulting in a more flavorful brew.\r\n\r\nDuring Prohibition, the Stroh family operated the business under the name The Stroh Products Company, producing near beer (beer with its alcohol extracted), birch beer, soft drinks, malt products, ice cream, and ice. Though production of most of these items ceased when Prohibition ended in 1933, Stroh Ice Cream can still be enjoyed at parlors today.\r\n\r\nThe Stroh Brewery grew alongside the other titans of Detroit industry. In 1964 the company made its first move toward expansion when it bought the Goebel Brewing Company, with an eye towards national distribution. As other national brands began to enter the Detroit market, Stroh began to aggressively pursue other markets.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, Peter Stroh's willingness to depart from years of tradition enabled Stroh's to survive, but the changes were hard to swallow for many Stroh's employees. Stroh broke the company's tradition of family management and recruited managers from other companies. He also introduced a light beer, Stroh's Light.\r\n\r\nThough the brewery encountered many difficult times, the tradition and quality of Stroh's has never changed, and the quality of Bernhard's family-owned beer continue today, with Stroh's and Stroh's Light.","website":"http://www.strohbeer.com/","established":"1850","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uV6ou7/upload_dng2E8-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uV6ou7/upload_dng2E8-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uV6ou7/upload_dng2E8-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2012-08-01 12:14:51","locations":[{"id":"9LfmKk","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Tampa","region":"Florida","latitude":27.94653,"longitude":-82.459269,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
