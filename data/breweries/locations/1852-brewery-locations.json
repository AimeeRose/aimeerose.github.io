Wisconsin on May 11, 1852 from a village in Germany called Ichendorf, George Esser possessed little more than the clothing on his back, a talent for masonry, and a taste for good, traditional German beer. Esser started producing lager in a small brewery he bought in Monroe for $1,500. In 1863, he purchased 2 1/2 acres of land in Cross Plains. The original building had two cellars below and several rooms above to house Esser's family. The beer, known as Esser's Best, was first brewed in October, 1863. He was joined in this enterprise in 1881 by his son Jacob. At that time, the brewery had a capacity of 2,000 barrels. A barrel of beer cost $7, and a case containing 36 pint bottles was priced at $1.75. Jacob and his sons, primarily Werner (W.B.) and Peter (Spundt) began delivering beer to the surrounding communities, often starting out as early as 3 a.m. Werner acted as Brew master from 1907 to 1910. It was increased competition from the larger breweries that forced him to become a distributor. The first beer that he handled as a distributor was Hausmann's originally brewed in Madison in 1920, Werner became the distributor for Blatz Near Beer. Following Prohibition in 1933, the company again to distribute beer. It should be noted that during prohibition, Werner and his brothers were kept very busy taking care of the beer needs in the area, mostly doing business at night. In 1937, Werner's eldest son, Roman, became a partner. At this point, the company began to handle Old Style products out of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The family tradition continued when Del Esser, Werner's youngest son, joined the firm in 1948. In 1988, Roman's son, Wayne, took over the business. In 1990, Wayne was joined in the business by his son, Larry, which made six generations of Essers in the bee business. It should also be noted that the Essers were distributors of Blatz and Old Style products until they sold the distributorship in January 1998 to Frank Beer in Middleton, Wisconsin. Frank beer is currently the distributor of Esser's Best in the area.","website":"http://www.essersbest.com/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xHovlT/upload_RDu1B5-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xHovlT/upload_RDu1B5-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xHovlT/upload_RDu1B5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2012-04-13 18:31:55","locations":[{"id":"MWi5Kp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2109 Hickory Street","locality":"Cross Plains","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53528","phone":"1-608-798-3911","latitude":43.114731,"longitude":-89.653129,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"X7fpqb","name":"Feldschlösschen Brauerei","website":"http://web.feldschloesschen-brauerei.de/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:02","updateDate":"2012-08-16 12:43:23","locations":[{"id":"FxyfOU","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Brauereistraße 2","locality":"Hamminkeln","postalCode":"46499","phone":"028 52 / 9 13 2","latitude":51.72886,"longitude":6.590165,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 12:43:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"Q4eTmd","name":"Potosi Brewing Company","description":"Founded in 1852 by Gabriel Hail and John Albrecht, the Potosi Brewery began as a small brewery quenching the thirsts of area farmers, fishermen and miners. In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"http://www.potosibrewery.com/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-01-08 21:22:00","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http://www.potosibrewery.com/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
