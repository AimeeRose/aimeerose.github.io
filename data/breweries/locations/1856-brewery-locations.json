Dahls Bryggeri","description":"E.C. Dahls Brewery (E.C. Dahls Bryggeri) is a brewery and soft drink factory based in Trondheim, Norway.\r\n\r\nE.C. Dahls Brewery was founded in 1856 by Erich Christian Dahl (1814–1882), a local businessman and consul-general from Trondheim. He was the son of Erich Dahl (1774-1821) Christine Lyche (1776-1861). His parents had been the owners of an import-export business and shipping company. In 1851, Erich Christian Dahl had bought the Sugarhouse (Sukkerhuset) in the Kalvskinnet area of Trondheim, where there had been a sugar refinery since 1754. Sukkerhuset was rebuilt for brewing. The brewery stayed in the building until 1984.\r\n\r\nThe first bottle of Bayerøl, a Munich-style dunkel, was sold in 1857. In 1910, the plant began to produce soft drinks at the brewery as well. Bayerøl was the most important type of beer until the early 20th century when Dahls Pils, a pilsener took over as the most popular beer.\r\n\r\nIn 1966, it was merged with Trondheim Akti Brewery (Trondhjems Aktiebryggeri), which was founded in 1899 and Trondheim Brewery (Trondhjems Bryggeri) which dated to 1919. E.C. Dahls Bryggeri is now owned by Ringnes, part of the Group Carlsberg AS.","website":"http://www.ringnes.no/","established":"1856","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4E9qej/upload_ZpZDfn-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4E9qej/upload_ZpZDfn-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4E9qej/upload_ZpZDfn-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-02 11:33:37","updateDate":"2014-09-02 11:51:37","locations":[{"id":"bGabak","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Strandveien 71","region":"Trondheim","postalCode":"7042","phone":"+47 73 58 15 00","website":"http://ringnes.no/","latitude":63.440875,"longitude":10.4270105,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NO","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-02 11:51:24","updateDate":"2014-09-02 11:51:24","country":{"isoCode":"NO","name":"NORWAY","displayName":"Norway","isoThree":"NOR","numberCode":578,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"4Hyqzn","name":"Henry Weinhard","description":"Henry Weinhard's Private Reserve and Blitz-Weinhard are brands of beer first brewed in 1856 in Portland, Oregon, United States.
