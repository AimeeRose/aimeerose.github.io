[{"id":"s53vAs","name":"Birra Forst","description":"Just outside Merano, on the way to the Val Venosta, a complex of buildings perfectly in keeping with their surroundings catches the eye. They are decorated in a graceful, highly tasteful manner and almost blend in with the flourishing local vegetation. Anyone who is curious enough to ask the name of this “village” – because that is what it looks like at first sight – will simply receive the answer “That’s FORST”. It is not called the “beer factory” or the “brewery”, but “FORST”. The name is inherently linked with the local area. It stands for tradition and love for nature, but also striving to ensure that the quality of its products remains consistently high. Traditional and modern values go hand in hand, making positive contributions to each other: this is the guiding concept of FORST.","website":"http://www.forst.it/","established":"1857","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s53vAs/upload_T81xIw-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s53vAs/upload_T81xIw-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s53vAs/upload_T81xIw-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-04-10 10:18:32","locations":[{"id":"AnN3Lm","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Via Val Venosta, 8","locality":"Lagundo / Algund","phone":"39-0473-260111","website":"http://www.forst.it/","latitude":46.6804881,"longitude":11.1332369,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"IT","name":"ITALY","displayName":"Italy","isoThree":"ITA","numberCode":380,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"TwOeWu","name":"Lion Brewery Inc.","description":"With a proud brewing heritage dating back to 1905, The Lion Brewery merges rustic architecture with state-of-the-art brewing technology, a contrast typified by the gleaming stainless steel aging tanks that sit alongside the traditional copper brew kettle. Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.\r\n\r\nIn 1974 the Lion Brewing Company bought the Stegmaier Brand.","website":"http://www.lionbrewery.com/","established":"1857","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TwOeWu/upload_E6dFnP-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TwOeWu/upload_E6dFnP-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TwOeWu/upload_E6dFnP-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2013-05-10 01:58:10","locations":[{"id":"z0gnmN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"700 North Pennsylvania Blvd.","locality":"Wilkes Barre","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18705","phone":"800-233-8327","website":"http://www.lionbrewery.com/","latitude":41.2556575,"longitude":-75.858261,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1857","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"djGgca","name":"Stevens Point Brewery","description":"The Stevens Point Brewery is steeped in a history that has transcended the trials of the Civil War, the Great Depression and Prohibition.
