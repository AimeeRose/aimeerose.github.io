[{"id":"cFBlWc","name":"Bières de Chimay","description":"The Chimay Brewery is a Belgian brewery founded inside Scourmont Abbey, in the Belgian municipality of Chimay in 1862. The brewery produces three widely distributed ales and a patersbier exclusively for the monks; they are known as Trappist beers because they are made in a Trappist monastery. The brewing plant was updated in 1988, and as of 2005 produced 120,000 hectolitres annually.\r\n\r\nSince 1876 the monastery has also made cheese, and currently offers four cheeses.","website":"http://www.chimay.com/","established":"1862","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cFBlWc/upload_DlGSIl-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cFBlWc/upload_DlGSIl-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cFBlWc/upload_DlGSIl-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2012-05-30 19:01:01","locations":[{"id":"vLLvs6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Route de Charlemagne 8","locality":"Chimay","phone":"+32 (0)60 21 03 27","website":"http://www.chimay.com/","latitude":50.0356372,"longitude":4.3817714,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"1862","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"EDRBaP","name":"Brauerei Westheim","website":"http://www.brauerei-westheim.de/","established":"1862","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:18:50","updateDate":"2012-08-16 12:55:16","locations":[{"id":"aC2KSX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Kasseler Straße 7","locality":"Westheim","postalCode":"34431","latitude":51.493413,"longitude":8.904347,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 12:55:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"xUwGtE","name":"Frankenmuth Brewery","description":"Frankenmuth’s founding fathers brought the traditions of brewing to the Mid-Michigan forests in 1845. John Matthias Falliers founded Frankenmuth’s first brewery in 1857. Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.\r\n\r\nThe Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer’s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand “Fred” Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation’s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage. A brew pub was opened in 2003 and closed three years later.\r\n\r\nOur Frankenmuth Brewing Company, housed in the historic four story, 28,000 square foot building is an exciting destination for food lovers and beer aficionados alike.","website":"http://frankenmuthbrewery.com/","established":"1862","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xUwGtE/upload_VCaSiW-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xUwGtE/upload_VCaSiW-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xUwGtE/upload_VCaSiW-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2012-04-09 18:51:03","locations":[{"id":"IgdWNj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"425 S Main Street","locality":"Frankenmuth","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48734","phone":"989-262-8300","website":"http://frankenmuthbrewery.com/","latitude":43.330981,"longitude":-83.737896,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1862","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"zO43CF","name":"Leipziger Brauhaus zu Reudnitz","website":"http://www.reudnitzer.de/","established":"1862","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:58","updateDate":"2012-08-13 00:02:27","locations":[{"id":"naByaN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Mühlstraße 13","locality":"Leipzig","region":"Sachsen","postalCode":"04317","latitude":51.33098,"longitude":12.404375,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:46:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
