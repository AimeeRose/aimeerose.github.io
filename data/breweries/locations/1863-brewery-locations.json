It was available in bottles, cans and on draft. Its market area included Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky (very popular in Greater Louisville), Ohio, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and occasionally a few other states. Sterling Beer was brewed continuously from 1863 until the early 2000s when its latest owner, Pittsburgh Brewing Company, stopped making it after the company emerged from bankruptcy. The brand is in limbo and it will probably come back some day.","website":"http://www.sterlingbeer.com/","established":"1863","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Zhydrx/upload_DVnfH5-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Zhydrx/upload_DVnfH5-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Zhydrx/upload_DVnfH5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-17 20:55:50","updateDate":"2014-06-18 01:32:19","locations":[{"id":"IkCzV8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3214 Preston Highway","locality":"Louisville","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"40213","website":"http://www.sterlingbeer.com/","latitude":38.20188,"longitude":-85.734649,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-18 01:31:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
