[{"id":"yFgliy","name":"Ahnapee Brewery","description":"Ahnapee Brewing first opened its doors in 1868 in the city of Ahnapee, now named Algoma, as a premier producer of Wisconsin craft beers. Bohemian immigrants brought skilled craftsmen to erect Kewaunee County’s first sizable building.\r\n\r\nBeers were produced under the supervision of the head brewmaster, Henry Schmiling, the great- great-great-great uncle of the current owners. The Civil War veteran sold barrels of Wisconsin craft beers by horse and sleigh, rail, and the schooner, “Whisky Pete.” Schmiling’s Ahnapee Lager was known far and wide for its Wisconsin-made quality. Hops blight put the original brewery out of business in 1886.\r\n\r\nA new chapter in the brewery’s history began in the summer of 2013. Fueled by the dreams of our General Manager and Head Brewer, Nick Calaway, we picked up where Henry left off. This time Wisconsin craft beers are produced in small batches and feature full-flavored beer, some with aging potential, served in the Tap Room two doors down from von Stiehl winery at 105 Navarino Street.","website":"http://vonstiehl.com/","established":"1868","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yFgliy/upload_x1LZsA-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yFgliy/upload_x1LZsA-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yFgliy/upload_x1LZsA-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-10 02:09:12","updateDate":"2014-11-13 18:17:49","locations":[{"id":"aNU3n7","name":"Tap Room","streetAddress":"105 Navarino St","locality":"Algoma","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54201","phone":"(920) 785-0822","website":"http://vonstiehl.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\n","latitude":44.608969,"longitude":-87.435164,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-10 02:11:11","updateDate":"2014-11-13 18:17:38","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"6IV6lH","name":"Braustolz Brauerei","website":"http://www.braustolz.de/","established":"1868","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:51","updateDate":"2012-08-16 01:40:51","locations":[{"id":"cpgM4F","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Am Feldschlößchen 18","region":"Chemnitz","postalCode":"D-09116","latitude":50.798324,"longitude":12.862028,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 01:41:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"EbIDkz","name":"Hirschenbrauerei","website":"http://www.hirschenbrauerei.de/","established":"1868","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:16:35","updateDate":"2012-08-16 13:42:15","locations":[{"id":"KElhLo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Goethestraße 21","locality":"Waldkirch","postalCode":"79183","latitude":48.093616,"longitude":7.960497,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 13:42:36","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"UFie4f","name":"Monteith's Brewing Co","description":"Monteith’s has been crafting its family of fine beers for nigh on 150 years, staying true to the authentic process and recipes of the classic beer styles we re-create.
