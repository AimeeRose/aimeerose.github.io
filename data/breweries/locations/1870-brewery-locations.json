[{"id":"rljvd7","name":"Amstel Brewery","description":"The brewery was founded on June 11, 1870 in Amsterdam and named after the Amstel River, the waters of which also served for refrigeration. By 1872, Amstel was annually producing 10,000 hectoliters. For the purpose of storing the beer, winter ice from canals was kept in special double-walled cellars. Originally, the beer was mostly drank in Amsterdam. From 1883, it was also exported to Great Britain and Indonesia.","website":"http://www.amstel.com/","established":"1870","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rljvd7/upload_LTUZWN-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rljvd7/upload_LTUZWN-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rljvd7/upload_LTUZWN-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-05-05 11:56:06","locations":[{"id":"IOz8d9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Antwoordnummer 7181","locality":"Amsterdam","region":"Amsterdam","phone":"800-022-9885","website":"http://www.amstel.com/","latitude":52.373095,"longitude":4.893305,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NL","yearOpened":"1870","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"NL","name":"NETHERLANDS","displayName":"Netherlands","isoThree":"NLD","numberCode":528,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"JRrnyB","name":"Anaheim Brewery","description":"We’re a 140-year old company that just opened.
