It all began in the 1500”s. French Canadian trappers traveling west along the famous Red River Trail discovered this natural spring, which had the most refreshing water. Word of this spring spread and became a regular stop for all settlers going west on the Red River Trail. In 1857 Swiss born naturalist Armond DuPont wrote, “it is a water like no other, unique in its ability to refresh.” He noted, “Though seemingly impossible, a year-round frost forms at the base of this amazing spring.”\r\n\r\nThe brewery was built at the site of the spring and its water became the basis of all the award winning brews for over 125 years. In addition, the brewery has become the #1 energy drink and specialty drink producer in the country. We personally invite you to explore and enjoy our great water, drinks and brews.","website":"http://www.coldspringbrewery.com/","established":"1874","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GhJ5ei/upload_hmyy4U-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GhJ5ei/upload_hmyy4U-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GhJ5ei/upload_hmyy4U-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-11 23:28:45","locations":[{"id":"czEE4b","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"219 Red River Avenue North","locality":"Cold Spring","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"56320","phone":"320-685-8686","website":"http://www.coldspringbrewery.com/","latitude":45.4582465,"longitude":-94.4290551,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
