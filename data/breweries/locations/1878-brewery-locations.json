[{"id":"hD9pCH","name":"Brauerei Aying Franz Inselkammer KG","description":"Brauerei Aying has a long-standing reputation for excellence in beer and hospitality. Although Ayinger Brewery was founded in a picturesque village 25 kilometers from Munich in 1878, the site of the Ayinger Gasthaus Brewery Hotel has been one of Bavaria's most famous restaurants for more than 500 years.\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of the Alps, nestled in the 1200 year-old village of Aying (pronounced eye-ing), Brauerei Aying produces 12 different styles of beers, more than most of the larger breweries. The Ayinger Brewery has been owned and operated by the same family since 1878 and represents one of the most pleasant and interesting small breweries which are typical of Europe. Brewing good beer is the premier duty of Aying, and people come from all over the world to sample the wares.\r\n\r\nIn a land of wonderful breweries, Ayinger is considered a benchmark of excellence. In recent years, Ayinger regularly places first in every category entered in the World Beer Championships; the brewery has gold medals from the Helsinki Beer Fest, the Stockholm Beer & Whiskey Festival, the Calagary Brewfest, and the Deutsche Landwirtschaftsgesellschaft (German Agricultural Society).","website":"http://en.ayinger-bier.de/","established":"1878","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hD9pCH/upload_cTQXXV-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hD9pCH/upload_cTQXXV-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hD9pCH/upload_cTQXXV-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2012-04-21 12:27:16","locations":[{"id":"rBxNNF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Münchner Straße 21","locality":"Aying","postalCode":"85653","phone":"49-(0)8095-/-9065-0","website":"http://en.ayinger-bier.de/","latitude":47.970655,"longitude":11.779446,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"0HAazs","name":"Brauerei Blank","website":"http://www.brauerei-blank.de/","established":"1878","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:18","updateDate":"2012-08-13 11:25:33","locations":[{"id":"XQzpOM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Von-Speth-Str. 19","locality":"Zwiefaltendorf","region":"Baden-Württemberg","postalCode":"88499","latitude":48.215107,"longitude":9.516896,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:47:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"OkLgE4","name":"Castlemaine Perkins","description":"The XXXX Ale House and Brewery Tours provide an unbeatable way to experience an Australian icon up close and discover its proud legend. \r\nThe Castlemaine Perkins Brewery was established at Milton, just west of Brisbane city, way back in 1878.
