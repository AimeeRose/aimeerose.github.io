Like the history of brewing in Philadelphia the name Philadelphia Brewing Company has gone through many revivals. The same can be said of our brewery building - the former Wiesbrod and Hess Brewing Company complex in Kensington. At Philadelphia Brewing Co we take pride in our brews, our people, and our community. One person could never do everything that it takes to get beer into your glass. And it may sound obvious, but we won't brew anything that we wouldn't drink ourselves - you won't catch us drinking anything called Ultra unless it's a literal name meaning more flavor, more hops, more malt, more carbs. That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co! You can find our four brands on tap at finer establishments all around town!","website":"http://philadelphiabrewing.com","established":"1885","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/I3zXID/upload_8GqPLq-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/I3zXID/upload_8GqPLq-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/I3zXID/upload_8GqPLq-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2012-06-22 18:23:15","locations":[{"id":"I9iOxV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2423 Amber St","locality":"Philadelphia","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"19125","phone":"215-427-BREW (2739)","website":"http://philadelphiabrewing.com/index.htm","latitude":39.982733,"longitude":-75.127469,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"9K0AXZ","name":"Privater Brauereigasthof Adler","website":"http://www.adlerbrauerei.com/","established":"1885","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:17","updateDate":"2012-08-13 11:24:55","locations":[{"id":"SyHHLk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Ortsstraße 1","locality":"Hundersingen","region":"Baden-Württemberg","postalCode":"88518","latitude":31.76301,"longitude":-106.4856,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-13 11:25:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
