Today, beer connoisseurs in Germany and around the world regard our traditional specialty beers from Erding, Bavaria, as the ultimate in wheat beer enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of Erdinger Weissbräu date back to 1886, the year in which construction of a wheat beer brewery in Erding was first officially recorded. After several changes in ownership, the General Manager at the time, Franz Brombach, bought the brewery in 1935 and re-named it Erdinger Weissbräu on December 27, 1949.\r\n\r\nIn 1965, the son of Franz Brombach, Werner Brombach, entered the business. He took over the private brewery in 1975 and still leads his father's successful business today. In addition to a strong emphasis on quality, Werner Brombach focuses above all on a targeted sales and promotion strategy with a clear brand identity, which highlights the values of the old Bavarian beer specialty and its superior quality standards.\r\n\r\nToday, Erdinger weissbier stands for wheat beer enjoyment and the Bavarian brewing tradition. The traditional brewery has established itself as the national and international market leader for weissbier. As one of Germany's largest private breweries, Erdinger Weissbräu is among the leaders on the national German beer market.","website":"http://www.erdinger.de","established":"1886","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m9SH4l/upload_FwusIa-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m9SH4l/upload_FwusIa-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m9SH4l/upload_FwusIa-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-05-05 12:00:55","locations":[{"id":"qVyAhN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Franz-Brombach-Strae 1-20","locality":"Erding","region":"Bayern","phone":"49-(0)8122-/-4090","latitude":48.31532,"longitude":11.89111,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
