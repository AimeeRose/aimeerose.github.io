[{"id":"qxAQSJ","name":"3 Fonteinen Brouwerij Ambachtelijke Geuzestekerij","description":"Drie Fonteinen is the only remaining traditional geuze blender in Belgium, using only 100% spontaneously fermented lambik beer, aged in oak casks, with no artificial sweeteners or other additives. The blendery is connected to the very popular Drie Fonteinen Restaurant in Beersel, on the outskirts of Brussels. The proprietor, Armand Debelder, buys pure lambik from three breweries in Belgium, ages them in oak, and blends them, employing the skill, knowledge, and supreme passion for real geuze that his father handed down to him. Drie Fontenein’s Geuze and fruit Lambiks (cherry, raspberry) are rare, highly prized, and indisputably among the best of Belgium.","website":"http://www.3fonteinen.be/index.htm","established":"1887","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qxAQSJ/upload_awf3wV-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qxAQSJ/upload_awf3wV-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qxAQSJ/upload_awf3wV-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2014-04-20 13:23:39","locations":[{"id":"nUwtfn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Hoogstraat 2A","locality":"Beersel","region":"Vlaams Brabant","phone":"32-02-/-306-71-03","website":"http://www.3fonteinen.be/index.htm","latitude":50.7666391,"longitude":4.3083771,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"nJjPsG","name":"Berghoff Brewery, Inc","description":"Berghoff’s history as a beer brand goes back over 120 years, and in that time it has developed a reputation of high quality and consistency. The first batch of Berghoff beer was brewed in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1887 by Herman Berghoff and his three brothers. Herman’s desire to expand the market for the family’s beer led him to sell the product at the Chicago World’s Fair where it received high acclaim. Since then, Berghoff has continued its success and relevance in the Chicago market and beyond.           \r\n\r\n   As the craft beer market has evolved, the brand has received fresh, exciting updates. Berghoff changed its brewing location and is now proudly brewed at Point Brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Berghoff has also refreshed itself with updated recipes and packaging. With consulting from brewing experts Randy Mosher and John Hannafan, Berghoff’s new, top-notch beers are ready to satisfy consumer demand. As the brewery looks to the future, Berghoff beer will continue to evolve as trends change, but will always maintain its roots as an authentic German-style brew whose history and tradition will never be forgotten.","website":"http://berghoffbeer.com/","established":"1887","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nJjPsG/upload_5EzK2B-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nJjPsG/upload_5EzK2B-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nJjPsG/upload_5EzK2B-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-16 18:24:04","updateDate":"2013-08-09 16:17:53","locations":[{"id":"kU9sBG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3122 W.
