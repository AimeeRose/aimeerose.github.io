[{"id":"jLYLAw","name":"Brauerei Reissdorf","description":"During the period of promoterism – at the end oft he 19th century – the breweries in Cologne sprang up like mushrooms. In this era the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF – then called OBERGÄRIGE BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF (TOP-FERMENTING BEWERY) – was founded in the Cologne quarter “Severinsviertel” in 1894. Its founder, Heinrich Reißdorf, derived from an old-established farmer family who were based in Zieverich – today a quarter of Bergheim/Erft – as farriers and coach builders. A few years later, in 1905, the name Kölsch was established for the top-fermented Cologne beer-speciality. Before, it was called “Wiess”. After Heinrich’s death on 25.02.1901, Gertrud Reißdorf managed the brewery until 1908. The continuance of the company had never been in danger, though, since the Reißdorf couple had five sons, Johann Hubert, Heinrich, Hermann, Friedrich and Carl Reißdorf.\r\n\r\nWhen the product range was diversified to further styles of beer – Märzen, Export (both a strong variation of Lager) and Pilsen – in 1923 the top-fermenting brewery was renamed to BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF – OHG. In 1917, when the men had gone fighting in World War I, Friedrich’s wife Katharina managed the brewery. The two had three sons: Heinrich Reißdorf, who was killed in an accident in the brewery in 1936; and the two proprietors Hermann-Josef and Karl-Heinz, who died in 1996 and 1997. They led the company through economically difficult times after World War II, when the brewery was destroyed to the extent of 90%. Against all odds, the two brothers managed to produce and bottle a “Einfachbier” (literally: simple beer) with 2-4% vol. alc. Today the business is continued in the fourth generation.\r\n\r\nDue to a prosperous development of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF, a new site for the brewery had to be found within the boundaries of the city of Cologne. Therefore, the company purchased premises in an industrial park in Cologne-Rodenkirchen. With the new production facility, a brewery with most modern brewing technology was built, which meets the highest quality criteria.\r\n\r\nContinuity and a sense for the necessary are the virtues which make possible to look back on 110 years of an existing PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF. The ongoing success and the positioning of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF in the highly competitive Kölsch-sector confirm this corporate philosophy imposingly.","website":"http://www.reissdorf.de","established":"1894","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2012-07-31 16:13:01","locations":[{"id":"tKLtLu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Emil-Hoffmann-Strae 4-10","locality":"Kln","region":"Nordrhein-Westfalen","phone":"49-(0)2236-/-9655-0","latitude":50.87533,"longitude":6.99444,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"OcFATq","name":"Brouwerij De Brabandere","description":"Belgium, the beer paradise, the land of good living and since 1894 the land that is home to the Bavik Brewery.
