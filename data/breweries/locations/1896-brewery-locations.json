[{"id":"6PBXvz","name":"Anchor Brewing Company","description":"Anchor Brewing Company’s roots date back to the California gold rush making it one of America’s oldest breweries. Its Anchor Steam® Beer is San Francisco’s original since 1896. \r\n\r\nIn 1965, Fritz Maytag acquired and revived the struggling brewery at a time when mass production of beer dominated and seemed unstoppable. Maytag started a revolution in beer that originated today’s craft beer movement. \r\nAn undisputed icon, Anchor is America’s first craft brewery where beers are handmade in our traditional copper brewhouse from an all-malt mash. At Anchor, we practice the time-honored art of classical brewing, employing state-of-the-art methods to ensure that our beers are always pure and fresh. We know of no brewery in the world that matches our efforts to combine traditional, natural brewing with such carefully applied, modern methods of sanitation, finishing, packaging and transporting.","website":"http://www.anchorbrewing.com/","established":"1896","mailingListUrl":"http://www.anchorbrewing.com/connect/contact","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6PBXvz/upload_GcROfI-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6PBXvz/upload_GcROfI-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6PBXvz/upload_GcROfI-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-25 23:51:40","locations":[{"id":"NzbBOK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1705 Mariposa St","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94107","phone":"415-863-8350","website":"http://www.anchorbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Two tours are available each weekday by reservation only.
