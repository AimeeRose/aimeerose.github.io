During its heyday, the Skagway Brewing Company and its brew master Herman Barthel, the most technologically adorned brewer on the West coast, produced up to 30,000 barrels of beer per year and had a bottling operation on site. Multiple breweries operated out of Skagway during the peak of the Gold Rush and by 1900 competition was fierce amongst them. With the Skagway economy on a decline due to the fervor of the gold rush ending and growing prohibition support, the Skagway Brewing Company closed its doors in 1904. In 1916, the “Alaska Bone Dry Law” was passed effectively ending the making and consumption of alcoholic beverages in the Territory of Alaska.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, a local entrepreneur reopened the Skagway Brewing Co. in the Golden North Hotel until 2002 when it again ceased operations. With the brewing tanks collecting dust and locals thirsty for microbrews, South Dakota native and long time Skagway resident, Michael Healy spotted an opportunity and bought the equipment in 2007. Operating in a brand new building, the Skagway Brewing Company again fired up the brew tanks and on July 4th, 2007 opened its doors once again much to the pleasure of locals and visitors alike. This bustling business keeps growing, frantically brewing to keep up with the high demand of its brews and quality-dining menu. We invite you to stop by 7th and Broadway for a fresh pint, delicious food, and a good time.","website":"http://www.skagwaybrewing.com/","established":"1897","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ixDWFe/upload_q7edet-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ixDWFe/upload_q7edet-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ixDWFe/upload_q7edet-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2012-07-22 14:22:01","locations":[{"id":"HGbr9s","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7th and Broadway","locality":"Skagway","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99840","phone":"907-983-2739","website":"http://www.skagwaybrewing.com/","latitude":59.45648,"longitude":-135.313169,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"7fBYOm","name":"Spendrups","description":"pendrups is a brewery with 1000 dedicated employees and with total sales SEK 3,1 bn.
