Eugène de Ro brewed his first top-fermented beer in 1898. 4 years later he was also brewing bottom-fermented beers. In 1929 the dairy closed, so the brewery was able to expand production into other types of beers: Bock, Export, Pilsner and Stout Ale. In 1950 they established their first bottling plant. Up until then the beer was only being sold in kegs. Between 1968 and 1990 they've been expanding by taking over breweries in the south of the Netherlands and North of France. In the 1990's they've started modernising the brewery. In 2010 this modernisation process was completed when they inaugurated their new kegigng hall. They're currently the third biggest pilsner brewery in Belgium.","website":"http://www.haacht.com/","established":"1898","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Fm39JC/upload_WMrszz-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Fm39JC/upload_WMrszz-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Fm39JC/upload_WMrszz-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-02 10:30:52","updateDate":"2012-11-02 12:20:49","locations":[{"id":"jfaN0S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Provinciesteenweg 28","region":"Boortmeerbeek","postalCode":"3190","website":"http://www.haacht.com/","latitude":50.965154,"longitude":4.60969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-02 10:53:27","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"oCpxft","name":"und Brauhaus Watzke","website":"http://www.watzke.de/","established":"1898","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:54","updateDate":"2012-08-16 11:43:06","locations":[{"id":"gMQvTa","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Kötzschenbroder Straße 1","locality":"Dresden","region":"Sachsen","postalCode":"01139","latitude":51.080719,"longitude":13.68807,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:45:26","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
