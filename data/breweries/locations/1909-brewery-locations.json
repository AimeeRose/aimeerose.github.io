[{"id":"f35hQR","name":"Spoetzl Brewery","description":"Spoetzl was founded in 1909, and claims to be the oldest independent brewery in Texas. A group of businessmen incorporated Shiner Brewing Association and placed Herman Weiss in as the company's first brewmaster. In 1914 a German immigrant brewer named Kosmas (or Kosmos) Spoetzl co-leased with Oswald Petzold with an option to buy in 1915. Spoetzl had attended brewmaster's school and apprenticed for three years in Germany, worked for eight years at the Pyramids Brewery in Cairo, Egypt, and then worked in Canada. He moved to San Antonio in search of a better climate for his health, bringing with him a family recipe for a Bavarian beer made from malted barley and hops.","website":"http://www.shiner.com/","established":"1909","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f35hQR/upload_8SElvW-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f35hQR/upload_8SElvW-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f35hQR/upload_8SElvW-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-13 11:39:45","locations":[{"id":"MLyOI0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"603 East Brewery Street","locality":"Shiner","region":"Texas","postalCode":"77984","phone":"800-574-4637","website":"http://www.shiner.com/","latitude":29.434494,"longitude":-97.166729,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1909","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
