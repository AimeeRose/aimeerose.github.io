[{"id":"Gn1xK0","name":"Franklin's Restaurant, Brewery & General Store","description":"Franklins is located in the heart of historic Hyattsville in a landmark building built in the 1880â€™s as a blacksmith and carriage shop. Starting in 1910, the building housed the Hyattsville Hardware Co. which stayed in continuous operation until 1992. In its heyday, the hardware Co. was the center of community activity, selling everything from pots and pans to remedies for livestock maladies, chicken feed and of course, nuts and bolts. Many people bought their first washing machines and iceboxes here. Trains from Baltimore stopped right out back and delivered loads of lumber, stacks of seed, even whole houses from the Sears catalog. Neighbors gathered and talked about the weather, the schools, rising prices and changing times","website":"http://www.franklinsbrewery.com/","established":"1910","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:12","locations":[{"id":"v0MKXA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5123 Baltimore Avenue","locality":"Hyattsville","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"20781","phone":"301-927-2740","website":"http://www.franklinsbrewery.com/","latitude":38.952612,"longitude":-76.940257,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1910","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
