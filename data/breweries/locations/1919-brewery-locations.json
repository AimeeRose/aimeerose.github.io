He was convicted, not once but twice, for breaking the federal Prohibition Act.\r\n\r\nProhibition was repealed in the late 1950s, but home brewed beverages were still illegal because they didn't bear the proper liquor stamps. Nevertheless, homemade Choc and wine continued to be available to regular customers at Pete's, a restaurant owned by Prichard in Krebs, Okla.\r\n\r\nThose customers happen to include JFK and high-powered Oklahoma politicians.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1995, through tireless efforts on the part of Joe Prichard, the grandson of the founder, Pete's Place reintroduced Choc beer as part of the restaurant's tradition and a \"legal\" brew for customers.","website":"http://www.chocbeer.com/","established":"1919","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TI53eD/upload_IiadV5-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TI53eD/upload_IiadV5-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TI53eD/upload_IiadV5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:12","locations":[{"id":"cAeitn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"120 Sw 8th St","locality":"Krebs","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"74554","phone":"918-423-2042","website":"http://www.chocbeer.com/","latitude":34.92723,"longitude":-95.725309,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1919","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"zpyLEw","name":"Le Pere Jules","website":"http://www.calvados-leperejules.com/","established":"1919","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-14 21:37:04","updateDate":"2014-07-15 11:28:03","locations":[{"id":"J3Wz2t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Route de Dives","region":"Saint-Désir","postalCode":"14100","website":"http://www.calvados-leperejules.com/","latitude":49.1421223,"longitude":0.2378338,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"FR","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-15 11:29:30","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"FR","name":"FRANCE","displayName":"France","isoThree":"FRA","numberCode":250,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"dfvT2E","name":"Les Brasseurs de Gayant","description":"Founded in Douai in 1919, this brewery is still a traditional, independent family business.
