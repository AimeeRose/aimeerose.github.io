[{"id":"kWJGj9","name":"Oriental Brewery","description":"Oriental Brewery or OB is a South Korean brewery established by the Doosan Group in 1952. It was purchased by InBev in 1998. In 2009, it was sold by Anheuser-Busch InBev as the parent company sought to reduce its debt. It was sold to an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.. Anheuser-Busch InBev has retained the right to purchase OB five years from its sale, at predetermined financial terms. Today OB produces several of Korea's most popular beverages including the OB, Cass and Cafri lager brands. All OB beers are brewed from rice, rather than the malted barley familiar to Western beer drinkers.","website":"http://www.ob.co.kr/","established":"1952","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:08","locations":[{"id":"1t7mJ1","name":"Main Brewery","website":"http://www.ob.co.kr/","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"KR","yearOpened":"1952","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"KR","name":"KOREA, REPUBLIC OF","displayName":"Korea, Republic of","isoThree":"KOR","numberCode":410,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
