Lion Nathan produced a beer the following year named Steinecker, named after the company whose equipment the beer was made in. The beer's name was changed in 1962, not in response to a challenge from the Steinecker company, but to distinguish it from Heineken.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 Steinlager was launched in the United States and an American consultant suggested that to become successful the company should change the colour of their bottles to match that of other premium beers. As a result, the original brown bottle colour was changed to green.","website":"http://www.steinlager.com/","established":"1957","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6sHf19/upload_kh1Id0-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6sHf19/upload_kh1Id0-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6sHf19/upload_kh1Id0-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:27:35","updateDate":"2013-05-10 18:54:55","locations":[{"id":"v8SqHO","name":"Lion Brewery","streetAddress":"55 Ormiston Road","extendedAddress":"Flatbush","locality":"Auckland","website":"http://www.steinlager.co.nz/","latitude":-36.9634165,"longitude":174.895644,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-27 01:47:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
