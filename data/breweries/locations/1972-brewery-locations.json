[{"id":"YtP8h9","name":"Blackthorn Cider","description":"The year was 1972 and a crack team of West Country master cider makers were tasked with making a new West Country cider to beat all others. \r\n\r\nAfter months of blending and many a late night tasting session, Blackthorn cider was born. The West Country know their cider, and The West Country liked it. \r\n\r\nWord quickly spread and Blackthorn rapidly grew to become one of Britain’s most popular ciders and one that remains true to its West County roots. \r\n\r\nShepton Mallet, in the heart of the West Country, is the home of the Blackthorn cider mill. It’s here that we’ve been making cider for over 50 years. The team that oversee the process have over 100 years\r\nof cider making experience (this is between them, they’re not really that old). \r\n\r\nWe are also the biggest employer in Shepton Mallet and over 90% of our fruit comes from within 50\r\nmiles from here. We have long term relationships with 68 local growers from Somerset, Devon, Dorset and Herefordshire where all the finest cider apples come from.","website":"http://www.blackthorn.uk.com/","established":"1972","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YtP8h9/upload_7IW73R-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YtP8h9/upload_7IW73R-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YtP8h9/upload_7IW73R-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-08 01:23:55","updateDate":"2014-06-09 11:20:43","locations":[{"id":"hkJC9Y","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Whitchurch Lane","locality":"Bristol","region":"Gloucestershire","postalCode":"BS14 0BZ","website":"http://twitter.com/blackthorncider","latitude":51.4070692,"longitude":-2.5657784,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","yearOpened":"1972","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-09 11:17:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
