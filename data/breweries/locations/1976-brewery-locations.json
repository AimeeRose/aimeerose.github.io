[{"id":"Lbvvk1","name":"Back Street Brewery","description":"Our neighborhood brewpubs bring together Lamppost Pizza's award winning pizza with the freshest handcrafted ales and lagers.\r\n\r\nOur brewmasters use traditional brewing methods along with the finest imported ingredients available. We brew our beers in small batches to ensure freshness and quality. Although our methods are more expensive, we believe this process creates the best tasting beer.\r\n\r\nAs a brewpub, we allow our brewmasters more freedom to brew a variety of styles, and we have a constantly rotating variety of beers on tap. Our brewmasters create four to seven variety beers, while keeping four favorite, constant brews always on tap.","website":"http://backstreetbrew.com","established":"1976","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Lbvvk1/upload_Ra4E4k-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Lbvvk1/upload_Ra4E4k-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Lbvvk1/upload_Ra4E4k-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-03-12 14:08:06","locations":[{"id":"zo4Tui","name":"Irvine","streetAddress":"14450 Culver Dr","extendedAddress":"Ste E","locality":"Irvine","region":"California","postalCode":"92604","phone":"(949) 857-0160","website":"http://www.lamppostpizza.com/backstreet/","latitude":33.7080461,"longitude":-117.784273,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1976","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GUQ040","name":"Corona","streetAddress":"300 N.
