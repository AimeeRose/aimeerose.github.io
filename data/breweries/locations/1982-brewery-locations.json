[{"id":"D7h5Pj","name":"Brasserie D'Achouffe","description":"Towards the end of the 1970s, Pierre Gobron and Christian Bauweraerts (two brother-in-laws) decided to create their own beer in their own brewery. \r\nWith initially only a small amount of money available to them (200.000Bfr, less than 5.000€), they started out on what the fans of the brewery call the ‘Chouffe story’. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning its founders thought of it as a hobby, but the brewery developed at such a rate that, one by one, they decided to devote themselves to the adventure full-time. The first ‘brassin’ (brewing mix) of LA CHOUFFE (49 litres) was finished on 27th August 1982.\r\n\r\nThe elves of Achouffe were impatient to discover new countries, and their Dutch cousins were the first to give them a warm welcome. Even today, the Netherlands is the major destination of Achouffe Beers outside Belgium. Nowadays, more than 20 countries worldwide are supplied with our ‘nectar’ from the Ardennes forests. Coveted international awards have also been received year after year to reward their unique taste.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the summer of 2006 the founders of the Brewery chose to entrust the future of their dear elves to the Duvel Moortgat Brewery. The group’s wish is to invest in Achouffe and to develop the full potential of the Brewery.","website":"http://www.achouffe.be/","established":"1982","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D7h5Pj/upload_uOaWWF-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D7h5Pj/upload_uOaWWF-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D7h5Pj/upload_uOaWWF-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2012-11-02 11:08:38","locations":[{"id":"QYiAND","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Achouffe 32","region":"Houffalize","postalCode":"6666","phone":"32-061-28-81-47","website":"http://www.achouffe.be/","latitude":50.16569,"longitude":5.720881,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"2FmzR8","name":"Brouwerij Corsendonk","description":"Corsendonk is a brand of beers produced under the license by Brasserie Du Bocq.

Unlike others that brew “Pale Ale Style”  Our beer is brewed on an Authentic British Pale Ale Brew House using the finest English Pale Ale Malt, American Hops and Yeast.  I have been brewing American Pale Ales since 1982, back in the days when I brewed 20 Liters at a time as a homebrewer.  Today I brew 2000 Liters at a time (more friends then back then).  I grew up in Northern California during the Microbrewery Revolution and you will taste that in my beers. Of course I never pasteurize our beers or add anything artificial.  Trust me when I say, Beer coming from Pfäffikon to your dinner table will taste fresher than beer brought in a container traveling 2 months over the ocean.  Don’t just take our word for it, Biergenuss Magazine calls us “The Rothschild of Beer”. Thanks to all of you for making Western Rider the number one selling Pale Ale in Switzerland. Unlike many other brands, we are not brewed in Germany or in another Kanton and then sold as a “Local” or “Swiss Beer”. We are also not a big beer factory, owned by a European neighbor.  With every Sudwerk Beer, you are enjoying an Authentic Pale Ale produced here in Switzerland, by a family owned and operated “Kleinbrauerei”/Microbrewery. With every Sudwerk Beer, you enjoy the true meaning of Swiss Quality and the results of good old fashioned hard work.  You can find us in larger COOP Stores in the German and French speaking parts of Switzerland, on the Bahnhofstrasse in Jelmoli, Rio Getränke, Drinks of the World as well as in over 100 Restaurants and Hotels. In Zürich, we are distributed by Heineken Distribution, Intercomestibles AG and Schatt Getränke. Quality without compromise. If you are ever in the neighborhood, come by and visit us!  And do follow us on Twitter and Facebook.","website":"http://sudwerk.ch","established":"1982","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bRKIdZ/upload_pmdJRv-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bRKIdZ/upload_pmdJRv-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bRKIdZ/upload_pmdJRv-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-18 03:44:48","updateDate":"2013-02-18 14:39:45","locations":[{"id":"J9jdSt","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Speckstrasse 3","region":"Pfäffikon","postalCode":"CH-8330","phone":"044 / 950 99 00","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"SE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-18 14:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"SE","name":"SWEDEN","displayName":"Sweden","isoThree":"SWE","numberCode":752,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
