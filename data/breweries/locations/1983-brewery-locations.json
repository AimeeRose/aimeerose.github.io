The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an “amateur mountaineering expedition” to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it’s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That’s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don’t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn’t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn’t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, “it is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","website":"http://www.flyingdogales.com/","established":"1983","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_0z9L4W-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_0z9L4W-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_0z9L4W-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-11 23:24:34","locations":[{"id":"EPqUQP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Blvd","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21703","phone":"301-694-7899","website":"http://www.flyingdogales.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","latitude":39.361926,"longitude":-77.424677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"2BFwoJ","name":"Hales Ales Brewery and Pub","description":"Founded by Mike Hale in 1983, Hale's Ales is the Northwest's 3rd oldest and longest running independently owned brewery in the Northwest.

Alva was chosen as the location as this allowed us to carry on using the outstanding soft water from the Ochil Hills.\r\n\r\nHarviestoun Brewery was later bought by Caledonian Brewery in 2006. However, in the wake of the acquisition of Caledonian brewing Company by Scottish & Newcastle UK, the brewery became independent once again in 2008 by three noble shareholders who sought to preserve the status as an independent award-winning micro-brewery. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Harviestoun is going through some new and exciting changes to expand the brewery.
