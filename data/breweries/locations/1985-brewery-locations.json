[{"id":"noGtDY","name":"Bell's Brewery, Inc.","description":"Bell's Brewery, Inc. began in 1985 with a quest for better beer and a 15 gallon soup kettle. Since then, we've grown into a regional craft brewery that employs more than 200 people over an 20 state area, in addition to Puerto Rico and Washington DC. The dedication to brewing flavorful, unfiltered, quality craft beers that started in 1985 is still with us today. We currently brew over 20 beers for distribution as well as many other small batch beers that are served at our pub in Kalamazoo, the Eccentric Cafe. Our ongoing goal is to brew thoughtfully, creatively and artistically. We strive to bring an authentic and pleasant experience to all of our customers through our unique ales and beers.","website":"http://www.bellsbeer.com/","established":"1985","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/noGtDY/upload_t0bnSw-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/noGtDY/upload_t0bnSw-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/noGtDY/upload_t0bnSw-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-07-25 18:43:30","locations":[{"id":"NnffJ2","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8938 Krum Ave.","locality":"Galesburg","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49053","phone":"269-382-2338","website":"http://www.bellsbeer.com/","latitude":42.2843486,"longitude":-85.4538497,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1985","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-09-25 20:15:04","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"uCUre7","name":"Bell's Eccentric Cafe","streetAddress":"355 E Kalamazoo Ave","locality":"Kalamazoo","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49007","website":"http://bellsbeer.com/eccentric-cafe/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 2:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am\n\nOur kitchen closes daily at 9 p.m.","latitude":42.2949613,"longitude":-85.5789817,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-26 11:44:59","updateDate":"2014-09-25 20:21:54","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Y0IatW","name":"Bell's Eccentric Cafe","streetAddress":"355 E.

The brewery, named after the first Duke of Wellington, uses natural ingredients and patient brewing methods to produce ales of timeless distinction, not unlike the Duke himself. \r\nWellington Brewery is proud to be celebrating 25 years of craft brewing in 2010.
