From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.","website":"http://www.alaskanbeer.com","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_32dIr0-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_32dIr0-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_32dIr0-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2014-11-18 19:59:18","locations":[{"id":"krIs45","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Dr","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801-9540","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http://www.alaskanbeer.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  8:00am -

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn’t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.

In small villages across Europe, it was the local brewer that filled the vessels of pubs and cafés with beer made from his own closely guarded recipes. With the advent of industrialization, however, local breweries all but disappeared, bringing to an end the era of the authentic microbrewery.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, a family of brewers decided to revive the traditions of the past that were deeply rooted in three generations of their family – thus the name The 3 Brewers – “three” for three generations of brewing tradition. The 3 Brewers opened its very first microbrewery restaurant in Place de la Gare à Lille in 1986. Since then operations have expanded to 28 locations in France as well as several restaurants in other parts of the world including Quebec and soon Ontario.\r\n\r\nLes 3 Brasseurs' success can be attributed to a unique concept: Fresh non-pasteurized beer made from the purest ingredients and from traditional recipes – all brewed right at the heart of each of our restaurants for patrons to see.","website":"http://www.les3brasseurs.com/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1AH8nV/upload_0u6plW-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1AH8nV/upload_0u6plW-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1AH8nV/upload_0u6plW-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-24 14:45:21","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:20","locations":[{"id":"Ez9FvZ","name":"Ste-Catherine","streetAddress":"732 Ste-Catherine St. W.","locality":"Montreal","region":"Quebec","phone":"514.788.6333","website":"http://www.les3brasseurs.ca/eng/ste_catherine.php","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: 11:30 -

In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.","website":"http://www.wasatchbeers.com/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/kNFBTV/upload_UDG4l4-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/kNFBTV/upload_UDG4l4-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/kNFBTV/upload_UDG4l4-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:12","updateDate":"2014-09-11 18:23:09","locations":[{"id":"eN6UkZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"250 Main Street","locality":"Park City","region":"Utah","postalCode":"84060","phone":"435-649-0900","website":"http://www.wasatchbeers.com/","latitude":40.6417724,"longitude":-111.4946778,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:12","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"Fr3ygj","name":"Weeping Radish Farm Brewery","description":"The Weeping Radish is the Oldest Microbrewery in North Carolina. 25 years ago it was illegal for breweries to sell their own beer directly to consumers; they had to go through a distributor. This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. \r\n \r\nRaised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water â€“ no additives, chemicals or preservatives. \r\n \r\nOur beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX KÃ¶lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish. And for those of you with a sweet tooth we make a fantastic Root Beer!","website":"http://www.weepingradish.com/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Fr3ygj/upload_VDXURw-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Fr3ygj/upload_VDXURw-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Fr3ygj/upload_VDXURw-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:12","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:10","locations":[{"id":"Rs3OQM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6810 Caratoke Hwy","locality":"Grandy","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27947","phone":"252-491-5205","website":"http://www.weepingradish.com/","hoursOfOperation":"PUB & Retail Hours\r\nMonday: Closed\r\nTuesday, Wednesday & Thursday: 11 -4\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11 - 4 / Sunday: 12 - 4","latitude":36.2197049,"longitude":-75.869811,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:12","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
