We’re not against bottling, and we will assuredly reach a point in the future where we will package our beer, but no matter how good a beer is in the bottle, it can never be better than the beer coming from a well managed tap. Often it will be not nearly as good. Why? Draft beer is fresher; that’s a big one. Packaging beer is a complicated process with lots of potential for bad things to happen.

The site was chosen by Grand Ridge for its exceptional water quality for beer making, given its position on the top of the mountains in the Strzelecki ranges. After extensive product testing to achieve the highest standards in pure beer, Grand Ridge commenced brewing in June 1989.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrand Ridge is at the top of the list in high quality beers. All the beers are produced to exceptionally high standards of flavour and purity, with no added chemicals or preservatives.  This typically results in a far less severe hangover, if any at all.\r\n\r\nAt Grand Ridge the quality of the beer is never compromised. The mission at Grand Ridge is always to make the best beer in the world. Grand Ridge is a 100% Australian, family owned company.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the Grand Ridge beers has been recognized with over 160 Australian and International beer awards. In 2002 at the Australian and International beer Awards Grand Ridge won 29 medals. This was more than any other brewery in the world including all 19 countries represented.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Grand Ridge won 21 medals including 6 best of class winners (double any other brewery in the world). In 2002, 2003 and 2005 Grand Ridge won Victoria's best beer for the Premiers Trophy along with 62 other international medals. Grand Ridge has won the title for Australia's best Lager, Ale, Dark, Stout, Wheat and Light beer categories.

All of our specialty malts are imported from the UK, as is our unique strain of yeast. The ales are naturally carbonated and left to settle or \"fine\" at cold temperatures, rather than being filtered. Filtration can remove much of the goodness from beer along with the haze. Another negative practice our Brewer avoids is pasteurization. Our natural and healthy brews are more lightly carbonated than the factory product, and served at a palatable 45 degrees F to bring out the fullness of the flavour for which we strive.","website":"http://swanshotel.com","established":"1989","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BMC26E/upload_KateuV-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BMC26E/upload_KateuV-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BMC26E/upload_KateuV-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-08 18:03:14","updateDate":"2013-08-12 22:08:34","locations":[{"id":"pcNq92","name":"Swans Brewery","streetAddress":"506 Pandora Ave","locality":"Victoria","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"V8W 1N6","phone":"1-800-668-7926","website":"http://www.swanshotel.com","hoursOfOperation":"24 hours a day (hotel & info)","latitude":48.4285262,"longitude":-123.3694717,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"1989","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 17:27:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"tNDKBY","name":"The Saint Louis Brewery","description":"Schlafly is the brand name of beers produced by the Saint Louis Brewery, Inc.
