The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.\r\n    Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising \"Brew your own beer\". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a \"brew master\", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.","website":"http://www.crabbylarrys.com/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m6aqF7/upload_OQ2A32-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m6aqF7/upload_OQ2A32-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m6aqF7/upload_OQ2A32-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:05","locations":[{"id":"WtMfgN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"237 West Butler Avenue","locality":"Chalfont","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18914","phone":"215-822-8788","website":"http://www.crabbylarrys.com/","latitude":40.2795164,"longitude":-75.2142895,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"xsnJ3o","name":"Durango Brewing Company","description":"Durango Brewing Company is the third oldest microbrewery in Colorado.

A microbrewery was in the original plans for the business but was not feasible at the time due to the high cost of equipment and space.  The Wildflower Café had enormous success, which helped the inspiration for the Crooked Rooster Brewpub’s opening in 1998, again founded by Doug Thayer.  Throughout the running of these side-by-side businesses, Doug always had brewing on his mind and began to experiment in 2002 with home brewing.  Receiving excellent feedback on his brews from several beer aficionados, Roosterfish Brewing’s first official beer, Black Walnut Nut Brown Ale (now known as Original Nut Brown Ale) was unveiled at the Crooked Rooster and Wildflower Café in 2004.  This was shortly followed with the Butternut Pale Ale, now known as Dog Tooth Pale Ale.  The drastic name changes occurred because the originals were rejected due to “implied ingredients” that weren’t actually present in the beers.","website":"http://www.roosterfishbrewing.com/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_XoXYMd-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_XoXYMd-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_XoXYMd-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:11","locations":[{"id":"TxaTZN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"223 - 301 North Franklin Street","locality":"Watkins Glen","region":"New York","postalCode":"14891","phone":"607-535-9797","website":"http://www.roosterfishbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 11:30 am - 12:30 am","latitude":42.381121,"longitude":-76.874257,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"yS64Yy","name":"Main Brewery","region":"Thüringen","latitude":50.9307183,"longitude":12.0076316,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:45:22","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"1QFuku","name":"Roslyn Brewing Company","description":"The Roslyn Brewing Company has been brewing hand-crafted and full-flavored beers in the old world tradition since 1990.
