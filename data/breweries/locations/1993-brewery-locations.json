[{"id":"jkbCNz","name":"75th Street Brewery","description":"75th Street Brewery is Kansas City’s first and best brewpub that opened its doors in 1993.  Located in the historic Waldo district, the Brewery is home to live, local music (including Kansas City’s own Brew Jam every Sunday, and live Bluegrass music every Wednesday).\r\n\r\nThe Brewery boasts award-winning hand-crafted beers (fresh growlers to go every day) and a made-from-scratch menu. 75th Street Brewery has received local, regional, and national awards and accolades, including the 1999 Gold Medal at the World Beer Cup for the Red-Eye Rye Beer.\r\n\r\n75th Street Brewery features beers brewed from the great traditions of England, Germany, Ireland, and Czechoslovakia. We also offer special seasonal styles with influences from around the globe. Each of our beers is produced from the finest barley and hops in the world and includes only four basic ingredients: Barley, Hops, Yeast, and Water. No additives or preservatives are used. Because our beers are handcrafted in small batches and kept cold, no preservatives or pasteurization are required. You are guaranteed a fresh and natural pint of beer every time.

At this time we were the only brewery in Syracuse, New York.\r\n\r\nThe Syracuse Suds Factory also has the claim of being the first brewery, in Syracuse New York, in 31 years to commercially ship its product to other outlets. On May 7th 1995 we shipped our first keg to Jack London's, a pub in Sidney New York. From that point on we have shipped to other accounts outside of Syracuse as well as local accounts.","website":"http://www.sudsfactory.com/","established":"1993","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/l4QDBq/upload_ca5I2N-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/l4QDBq/upload_ca5I2N-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/l4QDBq/upload_ca5I2N-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:11","locations":[{"id":"DcSoI4","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"320 South Clinton Street","locality":"Syracuse","region":"New York","postalCode":"13202","phone":"315-471-2253","website":"http://www.sudsfactory.com/","latitude":43.0480734,"longitude":-76.1536694,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"DxSPd0","name":"Trafalgar Brewing Company","description":"The Trafalgar Brewing Company (TBC) was founded by Mike and Nancy Arnold and George Hengstman in August 1993.
