In the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Recently, Ron Kutella and Chris Justema joined the parternship and what started as one brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge.","website":"http://cascadelakes.com/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/sIBGId/upload_qhACFI-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/sIBGId/upload_qhACFI-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/sIBGId/upload_qhACFI-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2012-10-23 14:12:33","locations":[{"id":"O2ScDy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2141 SW First Street","locality":"Redmond","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97756","phone":"541-923-3110","website":"http://cascadelakes.com/","latitude":44.256031,"longitude":-121.169251,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"C7u6RO","name":"7th Street Brew House","streetAddress":"855 SW 7th Street","locality":"Redmond","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97756","phone":"541-923-1795","website":"http://www.cascadelakes.com/pubs/7th-street/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am -

It started with the introduction of hop farming which flourished here until the end of the 19th century. Back then, Otsego and the surrounding counties produced most of the hops grown in the United States.\r\n\r\nTraveling through the upper Susquehanna Valley towards Cooperstown in July 1898, a visitor would have enjoyed the view of hop farms with those beautiful hop vines reaching toward the midsummer sky. Grandfather Eckler ws a hop farmer and he used to say, \"The hop was King in those days!\" His hop farm was in Westville, NY only three miles up the Cherry Valley from where our Brewery is now located. When it came time for the hops to be harvested, Grandma Eckler would \"put up\" a dozen people from \"the City' and they would pick the hops for their room and board and a \"vacation\" in the country. My mother, Cynthia Eckler Hall, said she always loved it when the hop pickers came to the farm. Everyone had a lot of fun during the harvest. When the blight devastated his crop in the early 1900's, grandfather turned to dairy farming.\r\nSettled by Englishmen in the early 1800's, Cooperstown once had two English-style breweries in town. Following that tradition, the Cooperstown Brewing Company was founded in 1994. We brew premium ales, porters, and stouts using the finest two-row English barley malts, West Coast hops and the English Ringwood Yeast.\r\n\r\nGrandpa would be pleased if he could see the Brewery. We have hops growing here that survived the devastating blight to New York hop farming and those hops grown here are used to finish our Back Yard India Pale Ale.","website":"http://www.cooperstownbrewing.com/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ybdwZK/upload_liqoWx-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ybdwZK/upload_liqoWx-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ybdwZK/upload_liqoWx-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:05","locations":[{"id":"hG1G1v","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"110 River Street","extendedAddress":"P.O.

We foster a team oriented management style. We offer an excellent casual, yet professional, dining experience for our guests, never pretentious, emphasizing \"fun & friendly... brewpub style\" menu selections and service. We are high-volume, fast paced and right in the middle of all the action for the dozens of events that take place right outside our doorstep on Prescott's hometown Courthouse Plaza. We are community minded and involved in many local events and fundraisers. Our kitchen is a 99% scratch kitchen, providing a large & varied menu. Our bar is lively and we attract people of all ages and backgrounds. We are hands-on owners and look for managers with the same philosophy.\r\n\r\nWe’re also pleased to announce that Prescott Brewing Company, the MICROBREWERY, is now an extension of our brewery operations!  With the introduction of PBC’s Liquid Amber Ale and Ponderosa IPA in cans, we quickly outgrew our little 7-barrel brewhouse that’s been our workhorse since opening in 1994.  So we bit the bullet and built an off-site microbrewery production plant out by the Prescott airport in 2011.  The first 30-barrel batch of Liquid Amber was brewed by John and Lead Brewer, Jan, on December 27th, 2011 and was a true better- late- than- never Christmas gift!  Look for both brands increasingly available throughout Arizona.  And thus the story continues.  \r\n\r\nPBC celebrated its 20TH ANNIVERSARY downtown Prescott in March of 2014….thanks to our many loyal supporters, locals and visitors alike. 20 years of hard labor...nah, not that bad, but 20 years in the restaurant business is a LONG time!  So, we’ll just keep on keepin’ on and are excited to expand the selection of canned product for distribution as production allows out at the airport location.\r\n\r\nYOU are included amongst those who've allowed us to thrive, contribute to our community and keep 65-75 employees on staff all year long! As everyone knows, these have been difficult times for many. We believe every one of us knows personally of someone who has struggled these past few years with job loss, or a small business owner who has had to lay off a good employee, or maybe has had to close their business. Luckily, PBC is okay, thanks to YOU. Not to say we wouldn’t want more of the dining dollars out there...but we’re extremely grateful for the continued support of those in our community and visitors from literally all over the world. We’d like to remind everyone that each of us can make a difference in our communities by shopping local, supporting locally-owned, independent businesses, supporting our local charities and non-profits and volunteering for our favorite causes. Prescott is an amazing community...let’s keep it that way!

The brewery is located in the West Bank village of Taybeh, 35 kilometers north of Jerusalem. It produced its first beer in 1995 and has since developed a global cult following. It has been described as a pioneer microbrewery in the region, being that it predated the first Israeli microbrewery, The Dancing Camel, by about ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilestones:\r\nBy 2005 the company was only able to produce 300 cases a week locally due to conflict with Israel. Taybeh beer sold in Europe is brewed and bottled in Belgium with the license held in Germany.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, an annual Oktoberfest-style beer festival was launched. Dubbed the Taybeh Beer Festival, it opens in the beginning of October.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Taybeh beer became the first Palestinian product to be franchised in Germany, where it was brewed and bottled for sale in Europe. Taybeh beer is also exported directly from Taybeh to Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, an Australian named Lara van Raay produced a documentary called Palestine, Beer and Oktoberfest Under Occupation, which focuses on the Taybeh Brewery and the Khoury family.\r\n\r\n\r\nProducts:\r\nThere are four varieties of Taybeh Beer: Golden, Light, Amber, and Dark. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, a new non-alcoholic beer variety was to be launched specifically for the local Palestinian Muslim market. \r\n\r\nThe original brand was Taybeh Beer Golden. The Taybeh Beer Dark and Taybeh Beer Light were introduced for the 2000 celebrations in the Holy Land. The Dark variety follows a classic style of the way monks brewed beer in the Middle Ages in order to fortify themselves during their fasting.","website":"http://www.taybehbeer.net/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-30 19:57:58","updateDate":"2012-07-30 21:47:14","locations":[{"id":"y8m51D","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Taybeh, Ramallah","locality":"West Bank","region":"Palestine","latitude":31.899205,"longitude":35.203356,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IL","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-30 21:53:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"IL","name":"ISRAEL","displayName":"Israel","isoThree":"ISR","numberCode":376,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"jP7oIL","name":"The Durham Brewery","description":"An innovative brewery that specialises in strong, bottle conditioned ales in Durham, North East England.","website":"http://www.durhambrewery.co.uk/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 17:45:49","updateDate":"2013-08-05 19:54:46","locations":[{"id":"bUBjTD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"The Durham Brewery Ltd","extendedAddress":"Unit 6a","locality":"Bowburn North Industrial Estate","region":"Durham","postalCode":"DH6 5PF","phone":"0191 3771991","website":"http://www.durhambrewery.co.uk/","hoursOfOperation":"Saturdays 10.00am - 4.00pm\r\nWeekdays 9.00am - 4.00pm\r\nOpen on Bank Holidays","latitude":54.7377195,"longitude":-1.5329159,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 19:56:31","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"WJa7QV","name":"Tommyknocker Brewery","description":"We are located in the Colorado Mountains in the cozy historic mining town of Idaho Springs.

The kitchen also serves up some excellent English pub food including burgers, bangers and mash, cheese platters and curries.\r\n\r\nSo come along and enjoy all that we can offer because, in the words of Lachlan McOmish, \"Life is too short not to enjoy the finest quality beers.\"","website":"https://www.facebook.com/wigandpen.canberra","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7pRSgt/upload_mJqT6e-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7pRSgt/upload_mJqT6e-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7pRSgt/upload_mJqT6e-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-21 22:07:33","updateDate":"2014-01-22 02:15:43","locations":[{"id":"GgLW9I","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"40 Marcus Clarke st","locality":"Canberra","region":"Australian Capital Territory","postalCode":"2601","website":"https://www.facebook.com/wigandpen.canberra/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Tue: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nWed - Thu: 11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri: 11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 2:00 pm - 8:00 pm","latitude":-35.2783921,"longitude":149.1264256,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"AU","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-22 02:15:24","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"5UPOLB","name":"Wilmington Brewing","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:10","locations":[{"id":"jST1sh","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"111 Bryan Road","locality":"Wilmington","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28412","latitude":34.170868,"longitude":-77.946875,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","yearClosed":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"VJ56AP","name":"Yaletown Brewing","description":"The Yaletown Brewing Company is Vancouver's original and best Brewpub.

So began the friendship of Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit.\r\n\r\nAs they made their way through college they continued to experiment with homebrewing and formulating new recipes. Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity. Working in a small English-style brewery in Western Maryland, Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit decided to take matters into their own hands, and in 1994, they founded Yards Brewing Company.","website":"http://www.yardsbrewing.com/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jwWiTH/upload_pXUGPy-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jwWiTH/upload_pXUGPy-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jwWiTH/upload_pXUGPy-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2012-10-22 13:18:06","locations":[{"id":"DXvlfF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"901 N.
