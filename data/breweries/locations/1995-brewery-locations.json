Brewed and bottled in small batches with only honest ingredients, BarrelHouse beers are extremely fresh and exceptionally flavorful. Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product. While our brewing process is quite labor intensive, we believe that hand-crafting our beers sets us apart from the majority of breweries in the U.S. today. Our dedication is unparalleled and quite evident in the final packaged product.","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2012-04-30 16:01:12","locations":[{"id":"iWyq08","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"544B W.

Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle’s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks—a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro.

That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site “This Old House meets the World Wide Web”—letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state.","website":"http://www.flyingfish.com/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/M5zcKb/upload_5NqI1c-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/M5zcKb/upload_5NqI1c-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/M5zcKb/upload_5NqI1c-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-09-11 19:57:34","locations":[{"id":"qjZIZq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"900 Kennedy Boulevard","locality":"Somerdale","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"08083","phone":"856-504-3442","website":"http://www.flyingfish.com/","latitude":39.853834,"longitude":-75.019803,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"zgCDhX","name":"Freedom Brewery","description":"Established in 1995, Freedom Brewery is a pioneer of premium craft lager brewing in the UK. Now one of the leading brewery’s in this sector, Freedom’s range of beers have won over 25 International and National awards in the last 4 years alone.\r\n\r\nAll Freedom Beer is bottom fermented in closed, pressurized vessels. Lager is fermented at a lower temperature than ale and therefore takes longer – between 7 to 14 days, in contrast to 4 to 5 days. During fermentation, the beer naturally carbonates itself as a result of the breakdown of sugars to alcohol.\r\n\r\nAfter the fermentation stage, the ‘young’ beer is transferred to maturation or storage tanks, where it’s stored at -1 ̊C. Freedom Brewery has a minimum maturation period of 4 weeks; this improves both the beer’s flavour profiles and naturally increases its stability, removing the need for chemical intervention. The verb ‘Lagerun’ is German for ‘to store’ – ironic as the majority of mass produced ‘lagers’ are brewed within days, with little or no maturation time at all.\r\n\r\nFreedom Brewery sterile triple filters its beers to remove any remaining yeast and protein cells. This is instead of pasteurisation which, whilst being a cheaper process, carries the risk of ruining the beer’s natural flavours. Freedom’s first sterile filtration uses diatomaceous earth in contrast to isinglass, which is a substance obtained from the swim bladders of fish. As a result, all Freedom Beers are certified by the Vegan Society.","website":"http://www.freedombrewery.com/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zgCDhX/upload_0hOLyo-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zgCDhX/upload_0hOLyo-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zgCDhX/upload_0hOLyo-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2013-08-12 22:23:31","locations":[{"id":"FEPzbD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5430 Shiloh Forest Dr","locality":"Midlothian","region":"Texas","postalCode":"76065","phone":"321-745-9819","website":"http://www.freedombeer.com/","latitude":32.517917,"longitude":-96.923991,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XWih3e","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Bagots Park","locality":"Abbots Bromley","region":"Staffordshire","postalCode":"WS15 3ER","phone":"+44 (0) 1283 840 721","latitude":52.8366558,"longitude":-1.8697278,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 22:25:23","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"qhtgmf","name":"Frog Island Brewery","website":"http://www.frogislandbeer.com/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:15","locations":[{"id":"BmCSoh","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"708 North Ypsilanti Road","locality":"Ypsilanti","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48198","phone":"734-320-2416","website":"http://www.frogislandbeer.com/","latitude":42.249947,"longitude":-83.585119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","yearClosed":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"77YOgn","name":"Front Street Brewery","description":"Located in Historic Downtown, the Front Street Brewery is Wilmington’s only Restaurant with its own Brewery.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he’d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes – John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process – while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers’ tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island’s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers – and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island’s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone’s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http://www.gooseisland.com/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_w0f4W1-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_w0f4W1-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_w0f4W1-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:16:07","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http://www.gooseisland.com/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"y8m51D","name":"Hausbrauerei Schlossturm im SI Centrum","website":"http://www.si-centrum.de/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:12","updateDate":"2012-08-16 13:35:28","locations":[{"id":"qxsSk4","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Plieninger Strasse 100","locality":"Stuttgart","region":"Baden-Wurttemberg","postalCode":"70567","latitude":48.722836,"longitude":9.162401,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 13:35:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"OXi7r1","name":"Heartland Brewery","description":"Founded in 1995, Heartland Brewery is a NYC-based restaurant group with 7 locations, all with their own distinct identities.

The Saratoga Resort and Spa consistently draws people from all over Colorado and Wyoming due to its unique offering of a variety of amenities in one location--such as an on-site brewery, mineral hot spring pools, great food, western-styled rooms, jeep, ATV and snowmobile rentals, a golf course and a full-service spa.  \r\n\r\nThe Snowy Mountain Brewery is gaining in exposure and was featured recently in Travel Pulse’s “5 Unique Beer Vacation Spots in the U.S.!”  The name Snowy Mountain is fitting for the brewery as it sits adjacent the majestic Snowy Range Mountains, in southern Wyoming. Boasting 8-10 different craft beers throughout each season, the Snowy Mountain Brewery is one of the fastest growing breweries in Wyoming and surrounding states. The famous brewpub, with a throw-back to the wild west, is adorned with big game mounts and bar-stools made with six-shooters and patinated saddles and features a full pub menu with selections that compliment Saratoga's finest craft beers.","website":"http://www.saratogaresortandspa.com/snowy-mountain-brewery/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_4X9zOz-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_4X9zOz-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_4X9zOz-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-09-19 17:53:04","locations":[{"id":"6txGoK","name":"Snowy Mountain Pub & Brewery","streetAddress":"601 Pic Pike Rd","extendedAddress":"PO Box 869","locality":"Saratoga","region":"Wyoming","postalCode":"82331","phone":"307-760-2302","website":"http://www.saratogaresortandspa.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Hours: 3 PM â€“ 9 PM","latitude":41.4534072,"longitude":-106.8020015,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"G2zUm1","name":"Stewart's Brewing Company","description":"Established in 1995, we are New Castle County's 1st brewpub.\r\n\r\nIt has always been our goal to provide the best handcrafted beer, fresh food & impeccable service.","website":"http://stewartsbrewingcompany.com/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/G2zUm1/upload_usm0p1-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/G2zUm1/upload_usm0p1-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/G2zUm1/upload_usm0p1-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2012-04-21 12:38:05","locations":[{"id":"JiKMgI","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"219 Govenor's Square","locality":"Bear","region":"Delaware","postalCode":"19701","phone":"302-836-2739","website":"http://stewartsbrewingcompany.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Open every day from 11:00am-1:00am","latitude":39.631737,"longitude":-75.662736,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"i1jKN5","name":"The Brew Kettle, Taproom and Smokehouse","description":"The BREW Kettle opened its doors in the fall of 1995 as Ohio's First Brew-On-Premise Microbrewery.
