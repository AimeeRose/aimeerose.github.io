Brewer’s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer’s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer’s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer’s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer’s Alley’s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer’s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it’s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick’s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick’s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith’s film \"The Birth of a Nation\", and the Manhattan Opera Company’s production of \"Madame Butterfly\", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer’s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland’s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building’s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.","website":"http://www.brewers-alley.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-10-10 17:02:34","locations":[{"id":"Qs29uy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"124 North Market Street","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21701","phone":"301-631-0089","website":"http://www.brewers-alley.com","latitude":39.4156043,"longitude":-77.4107676,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"dSKL9l","name":"Brouwerij De Cock","description":"After 10 years of experimenting with different recipes, brewery De Cock created their first beer called Sinpalsken.

(Tours are available upon request). The brewery has won dozens of local, national and international brewing industry honors in only ten years – a distinction not lost on micro-brew aficionados. \r\n\r\nSome of its more notable awards include being named Best Small Brewpub and Best Small Brewpub Brewer in America at the 2006 Great American Beer FestivalTM and winning gold, silver and bronze medals. Gold and silver medals were also awarded at the 2006 World Beer Cup. In addition, Flossmoor Station Brewery consistently receives top honors and recognition from the Real Ale Festival, Festival of Barrel Aged Beers and the Chicago Beer Society.\r\n\r\nProduced entirely on-site, Flossmoor Station Brewing Company’s beers are handcrafted from the finest ingredients available, brewed in small batches with close attention to detail, and transferred to storage tanks in Flossmoor Station’s beer cellar until its flavor is at its peak. When a customer orders a pint of beer \r\nupstairs at the massive oak bar, that lucky patron is assured of getting the freshest pint of brew money can buy. \r\n\r\nEight different beers round out the selection of “The Great Eight House Beers” which are offered on a regular basis at Flossmoor Station. In addition, beer enthusiasts look forward to the “Brewmaster’s Specials” which are offered in limited batches, including some seasonal favorites.

In fact, the wheat, barley, hops and yeast used to make Ramstein Beers are all imported directly from Bavaria.\r\n\r\nGreg found a special brewer’s yeast used only by a small brewery in Bavaria. He was able to get the brewery to let him use the special yeast exclusively at High Point. The unique, complex character of Ramstein beers is a result of this private yeast and of course, High Point’s careful and proper brewing methods.\r\n\r\nThe name Ramstein was adopted from a town in Germany with a large American population. The town surrounds the U.S. Ramstein Air Force Base. High Point wanted the name of its beers to reflect a marriage of German tradition and American innovation.\r\n\r\nToday High Point Brewing Company expanded beyond wheat beers and brews 11 different wheat beers and lagers.","website":"http://www.ramsteinbeer.com/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:06","locations":[{"id":"v7knzd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"22 Park Place","locality":"Butler","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"07405","phone":"973-838-7400","website":"http://www.ramsteinbeer.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Gift Shop & Tasting Room Hours: \r\nM-F 9am - 6:30pm \r\nSat 1pm - 4pm","latitude":41.0016015,"longitude":-74.3402902,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:28:37","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"wXIgSm","name":"Homer Brewing Company","description":"If you haven’t had the oppor- tunity to visit Homer, Alaska, we are located 220 miles south of Anchorage where the road ends and Kachemak Bay begins.\r\n\r\nHomer is known as \"The Cosmic Hamlet by the Sea,\" and once you’ve been here, you’ll understand why.

Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy.

In fact, he's managed to combine his scientific background with an artistic, if somewhat bohemian, flair for beermaking to create what The Globe and Mail and Vancouver Province newspapers have called some of the best suds around. \r\n\r\nBart's brewery skills are complemented by Tracey's tenacious management and marketing skills. Tracey has a degree in biology; but she too is immersed in the brewing business. She probably comes closest to using skills learned in courses such as zoology when calling on remote bars to demo cold Begbies to rowdy, and thirsty, patrons. \r\n\r\nThe brewery has seen expansion since it's beginnings.

At that time this hobby was quite unique. Jay knew then he would someday like to own a brewery and bring the beer industry back to Holyoke. In 1995 this dream came true. Jay, at this time, owned an old manufacturing warehouse on Cabot Street in Holyoke. He soon incorporated the Paper City Brewery, Co., Inc. From here the wheels were in motion, Jay spent most of his time in transforming the fifth floor of the warehouse into a functional, federally and state approved, micro-brewery. Under the supervision of head brewer Rick Quackenbush the brewery put out its first brew of Holyoke Dam Ale in November of 1996.\r\n\r\nToday, Paper City Brewery continues to grow with the addition of a new Head Brewer Ben Anhalt, Assistant Brewer, Jason Todd and an additional flagship beer, Ireland Parish Golden Ale. We have also brewed various seasonal ales such as Winter Palace Wee Heavy and Cabot Street Summer Wheat.","website":"http://www.papercity.com/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/UZ2dcQ/upload_bZI2hT-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/UZ2dcQ/upload_bZI2hT-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/UZ2dcQ/upload_bZI2hT-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:08","locations":[{"id":"terhw8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"108 Cabot St","locality":"Holyoke","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01040","phone":"413-535-1588","website":"http://www.papercity.com/","latitude":42.2011759,"longitude":-72.610427,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:45:15","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"xpvsEA","name":"Pelican Pub & Brewery","description":"Welcome to the Pelican Pub Brew House.

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL. The Two Brothers Roundhouse is a full service brewpub restaurant, music venue, offers banquet space for large parties and weddings and hosts the Two Brothers Cafe and Beer Bar! \r\n\r\nTwo Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Iowa and Missouri.","website":"http://www.twobrosbrew.com/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Cu5xXG/upload_1Io9ak-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Cu5xXG/upload_1Io9ak-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Cu5xXG/upload_1Io9ak-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-29 16:27:37","locations":[{"id":"jeOXxz","name":"Two Brothers Tap House","streetAddress":"30w315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","phone":"630-393-BEER","website":"http://www.twobrotherstaphouse.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nTuesday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nWednesday   3:00 - 11:00\r\nThursday      3:00 - 11:00\r\nFriday         12:00 - 12:00\r\nSaturday     12:00 - 12:00\r\nSunday        12:00 - 9:00","latitude":41.824906,"longitude":-88.211221,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"YOdPoo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30W315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","website":"http://www.twobrosbrew.com/","hoursOfOperation":"We are give tours EVERY Saturday at 1:00 and 2:30 and Sunday at 1:00.","latitude":41.824906,"longitude":-88.211221,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-26 12:57:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"AiMDyF","name":"Two Brothers Roundhouse","streetAddress":"205 N.
