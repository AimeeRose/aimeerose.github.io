We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became \u0003a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the \u0003facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA’s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great \u0003city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we’ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we’re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival. We’re now seven days a week for brewery tours and tastings, and we have full roster of weekly events.","website":"http://www.angelcitybrewing.com/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0ZIlVA/upload_6I5iTE-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0ZIlVA/upload_6I5iTE-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0ZIlVA/upload_6I5iTE-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-06-10 11:46:49","locations":[{"id":"5tw2Iw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"216 S Alameda St","locality":"Los Angeles","region":"California","postalCode":"90013","phone":"310-329-8881","website":"http://www.angelcitybrewing.com/","latitude":34.0466054,"longitude":-118.2378181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"h9obbv","name":"Atomic Ale Brewpub and Eatery","description":"Founded by Aaron Burks in 1997, Atomic Ale Brewpub & Eatery is the Tri-Cities’ first brewpub.

After 16 years of making great beer in the Bay Area, we have grown by leaps and bounds, yet we still produce many of our beers on the original steam-fired brewhouse that started it all.","website":"http://www.goodbeer.com/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QPe57Z/upload_t8ClLn-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QPe57Z/upload_t8ClLn-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QPe57Z/upload_t8ClLn-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2013-08-09 12:26:41","locations":[{"id":"t559gG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1195-A Evans Avenue","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94124","phone":"415-642-3371","website":"http://www.goodbeer.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\t9:00 am - 10:00 am\r\nFri - Sat:\t12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":37.7382569,"longitude":-122.3802492,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"8Jyw2B","name":"Springfield Brewing Company","description":"An anchor to the re-birth of downtown Springfield since 1997, Springfield Brewing Company is a must-visit destination for beer and food enthusiasts traveling the area.

Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home.

These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tröegs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tröegs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tröegs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tröegs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTröegs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tröegs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef’s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http://www.troegs.com/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http://www.troegs.com/about_us/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_3yONkx-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_3yONkx-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_3yONkx-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-10-02 15:58:31","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http://www.troegs.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nGeneral Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-10-02 18:04:49","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"daCbMw","name":"Tun Tavern Restaurant & Brewery","website":"http://tuntavern.com/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:14","locations":[{"id":"EF6nNa","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2 Miss America Way","locality":"Atlantic City","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"08401","phone":"609-347-7800","website":"http://tuntavern.com/","latitude":39.362029,"longitude":-74.438908,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:59:09","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"vKs97O","name":"Vermont Beer Company","description":"The Vermont Beer Co. can be found at The Perfect Pear CafÃ© in Bradford Vermont.
