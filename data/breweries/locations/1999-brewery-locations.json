Starting from this assumption, in 1999 The Tarricone Family takes over a factory, built in the '80es upon instruction of HM the Prince of Windisgraetz of the Austrian Family of Furstenberg who then bought the Prinz Brau Group. Later, in the '90es, this latter was acquired together with the Birra Moretti Group, by the Labatt Group.\r\nIn the next years, the Moretti-Prinz Brau Group was acquired by Interbrau and eventually by Heineken.\r\nThe entire know-how and the workers themselves have been kept by Drive Beer, thus assuring a continuity in the excellence of the brands produced. \r\nThe art of manufacturing fermented products and yeasts management is in the DNA of the Tarricone Family. Precisely, in the first years of 1900, the ancestor Giuseppe Tarricone owned several vineyards and produced an excellent wine. He was producing and selling his wine all across the inland of Lucania transporting it on his picturesque chariots drawn by horses. \r\nHe then moved the company office to Atella (PZ), and then to Bella (PZ), and eventually, bewitched by the beautiful landscape and the extraordinary nature of the surroundings of Muro Lucano (PZ), he settled down, together with his entire family of Corato origins, he married a Muro Lucano girl, whose name was Concetta Bianchini.\r\nTherefore, when in 1999 the Tarricone Family was suggested by Gerardo, one of the sons of the ancestor Giuseppe Tarricone, to take over the Brewery, belonging to the Heineken Group, it was almost physiological to the five brothers, Giuseppe, Vito, Carlo, Federico e Fabrizio, who at that time were expanding their businesses linked somehow to the food and beverages sectors, to accept this \"challenge\", which represented for the Tarricone Family a \"return to the origins\".\r\nThe Drive Beer, an industry of the national market, has managed to impose itself as a beer pole, entirely Italian, competing with the most famous multinational companies.\r\nFinally, the Company, based on the remarkable approvals made by operators, has then invested time and resources by recurring to the skills of expert advisors for realising an distributing the products.","website":"http://www.birramorena.com","established":"1999","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-02 19:51:45","updateDate":"2014-03-03 11:54:52","locations":[{"id":"A5ES81","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Z.I.

The recipe was developed by Willy De Lobel. In the absence of a brewing plant, Willy wandered through the Flemish hinterland in search of professionals that could brew his recipe.\r\n\r\nHis journey ended when he found the brewery of Dirk Naudts, called “De Proefbrouwerij”. There Dirk and his staff continued to perfect the brewing process of Viven. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Willy De Lobel decided it was time to pass on his demanding hobby, to a young and ambitious entrepreneur. In the little village of Sijsele, Willy found an enthusiastic successor in the person of Tony Traen, the son of the local liquor dealer Cyril Traen, who decided the beer was an enrichment for his company and has since taken on the job of carrying on the tradition.\r\n\r\nSince then, Chapel of Viven has undergone several changes: a brand new look, an improved recipe for the Monastery of Viven and a new name. Chapel and Monastry of Viven were baptized Viven Blond and Viven Brown.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 the time was ripe for an expansion of the range Viven. The idea to apply our Flemish brewing art to non-Flemish beers haunted Tony and together with Dirk he developed the recipes of the promising Viven Ale, Viven Porter and Viven Imperial IPA. These exceptional beers, that would truly tempt any beer connoisseur, have been successfully launched onto the beer market in 2010, making them accessible to a wider audience of beer lovers.","website":"http://www.viven.be/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:20","locations":[{"id":"02rQpe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Stationsstraat 89","locality":"Sijsele","postalCode":"8340","phone":"+32 (0)50 35 34 94","website":"http://www.viven.be/","latitude":51.2078041,"longitude":3.3173741,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"OCiWW5","name":"Catawba Brewing Co.","description":"Catawba Brewing Company - WNC's only family owned/operated brewery is 15 years old.

During his college days the head brewer, Derek Luke, reaquired a homebrewing kit he had given his sister and quickly went to work brewing and passing his knowledge along to the company's president, Brent Ryan. As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to \"The Man\". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.\r\n\r\nOn Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July 2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves. Since then we have expanded our product line and our distribution territory but continue to brew up a storm in our Middletown Brewery.","website":"http://www.newportstorm.com/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IphbdN/upload_4dE1nk-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IphbdN/upload_4dE1nk-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IphbdN/upload_4dE1nk-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2013-09-02 14:11:41","locations":[{"id":"oz1oll","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"307 Oliphant Lane","locality":"Middletown","region":"Rhode Island","postalCode":"02842","phone":"401-849-5232","website":"http://www.newportstorm.com/","latitude":41.5369904,"longitude":-71.2796012,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:18:19","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"JeH6oB","name":"Denmark Brewing","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:06","locations":[{"id":"jhjlYL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6000 Maribel Road","locality":"Denmark","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54208","latitude":44.351281,"longitude":-87.8069529,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"CWEvMg","name":"Elevator Brewing Company","description":"The Elevator Brewer and Draught Haus finds its home in the historic Columbia building, built in 1897 by the Bott family to house the Bott Brother’s Billiards and a gentleman’s saloon. The beautiful hand-carved, hand-split Philippine mahogany bar was created to serve the whiskey distilled on the second floor. The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Many myths and legends surround this historic building, including the presence of ghosts and spirits. Perhaps during your visit with us, you’ll encounter the unexpected.","website":"http://www.elevatorbrewing.com/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/CWEvMg/upload_4Llp8G-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/CWEvMg/upload_4Llp8G-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/CWEvMg/upload_4Llp8G-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-09-11 19:40:13","locations":[{"id":"OTB5EC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"161 N.

After homebrewing on the family farm for years, brewmaster Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.\r\n\r\nUsing equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.\r\n\r\nTheir Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.","website":"http://www.sandcreekbrewing.com/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_29jbgo-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_29jbgo-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_29jbgo-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2012-11-12 22:32:33","locations":[{"id":"TSKxwK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"320 Pierce St","locality":"Black River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54615","phone":"(715) 284-7553","website":"http://www.sandcreekbrewing.com/","latitude":44.2928569,"longitude":-90.8510691,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"Lp3Grm","name":"Schlachthof Bräu","website":"http://www.schlachthofbraeu.de/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:11","updateDate":"2012-08-16 15:02:10","locations":[{"id":"NBjiVH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Mühlstraße 15","locality":"Nürtingen","postalCode":"72622","latitude":48.605989,"longitude":9.306445,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 15:02:28","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"lZBw4B","name":"Schlossbrauerei Weesenstein","website":"http://www.weesenstein.de/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:20:12","updateDate":"2012-08-12 23:51:38","locations":[{"id":"r9nypM","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"Am Schlossberg 1","locality":"Müglitztal","region":"Saxony","postalCode":"01809","latitude":50.95442,"longitude":13.86028,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 23:52:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"12sfL2","name":"Silver Creek Brewing Co","description":"Established in 1999, Silver Creek Brew Company formed from a local home-brewers’ club.

After several years of apprenticing with other master brewers, Mark was ready to begin crafting beer using his own recipes.\r\n\r\nHe found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA; a historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia’s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Mark re-opened the doors and introduced the Starr Hill Brewery. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its historic building with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall, and it was there that Mark's delicious craft beers became a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world. Nineteen prestigious awards later, Mark’s brews continue to be a hit at beer and music festivals nationwide.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, in response to the growing demand, Mark moved from this small brewing operation to a larger brewing facility several miles outside of town, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's core and seasonal brews are now enjoyed in restaurants and music clubs throughout the Mid Atlantic and Southeast, and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores in the region.\r\n\r\nMark is proud of the awards his microbrews have earned, and the experts agree that he is among the best craft brewers in the country. But at the end of the day, what still matters most to Mark and his team of brewers at Starr Hill is giving people the gift of great beer.","website":"http://www.starrhill.com/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4TuN55/upload_zLn8EZ-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4TuN55/upload_zLn8EZ-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4TuN55/upload_zLn8EZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-09-10 14:43:54","locations":[{"id":"HZvqhd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5391 Three Notch'D Road","locality":"Crozet","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22932","phone":"434-823-5671","website":"http://www.starrhill.com/","latitude":38.0692617,"longitude":-78.6866452,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-09-10 18:18:10","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"ceEcjf","name":"Taps Fish House & Brewery","description":"Brewmaster Victor Novak brews approximately 1700 kegs, or 26,000 gallons of beer for TAPS on an annual basis.

This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume).

As a tribute to his father, who provided the inspirational and financial means to open the pub, Nico has named it Turtle Mountain Brewing Company.","website":"http://www.turtlemountainbrewing.com/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/emd8iK/upload_WFiEor-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/emd8iK/upload_WFiEor-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/emd8iK/upload_WFiEor-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-08-12 18:57:31","locations":[{"id":"YTASRd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"905 36th Place SE","locality":"Rio Rancho","region":"New Mexico","postalCode":"87124","phone":"505-994-9497","website":"http://www.turtlemountainbrewing.com/","latitude":35.242565,"longitude":-106.664416,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"ytIKJu","name":"Winery Exchange","description":"Winery Exchange was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Novato, California, USA.
