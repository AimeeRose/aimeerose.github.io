High Falls distributes its fine products across 41 states and Ontario, Canada.\r\n\r\nHigh Falls also brews beer for other beer companies, such as the Boston Brewing Company (makers of Sam Adams beer). As much as 50% of the output of High Falls' brewery is for other firms. High Falls also distributes beer for other companies, some as far away as New Zealand, which may explain why trucks bearing the brands of other breweries (such as Coors) are sometimes seen on their premises.","website":"http://www.geneseebeer.com/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qg6dpg/upload_1pRKB6-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qg6dpg/upload_1pRKB6-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qg6dpg/upload_1pRKB6-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2012-09-03 13:16:07","locations":[{"id":"4AaNXK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"445 St.Paul Street","locality":"Rochester","region":"New York","postalCode":"14605","phone":"585-263-9446","website":"http://www.geneseebeer.com/","latitude":43.164588,"longitude":-77.615456,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2000","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"rJLqpi","name":"Island Brewing Company","description":"Island Brewing Company has been brewing in Carpinteria, CA since July, 2000 and has steadily gained a following of enthusiasts along the Santa Barbara coast.

Soon he found himself president and heading up the Marin County State Fair competitions, and after burning out all the burners on the stove, he was banished to brewing outdoors. A certified beer judge, he worked at Marin Brewing Company before starting off on his own, moving south to Carpinteria. Now a family run brewery, Island Brewing Company has won awards on both the state and national level. We serve local bars, restaurants, and retail outlets and have five and fifteen-gallon kegs and 22-ounce bottles available for weddings, caterers, as well as for thirsty individuals that happen to come our way.
