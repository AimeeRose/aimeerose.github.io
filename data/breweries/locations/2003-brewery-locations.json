Often in the micro brewing industry, quality is compromised for quantity. We brew handcrafted, small batch beers to ensure freshness is as crisp as it is clean.

The brew house we call home is a 15 barrel Pub Brewing System located on the upper level of the impressive brewery interior.

It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.","website":"http://www.innisandgunn.com/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:34:11","updateDate":"2012-08-03 12:40:12","locations":[{"id":"0HAazs","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6 Randolph Crescent","region":"Edinburgh","postalCode":"EH3 7TH","phone":"+44 (0) 131 337 4420","website":"http://www.innisandgunn.com/","latitude":55.951976,"longitude":-3.211095,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 12:39:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"w7IFkJ","name":"Isle of Purbeck Brewery","description":"Established in 2003, the award winning Isle of Purbeck Brewery started brewing at the gateway to Dorsets world heritage Jurassic coast, nestled in the Purbeck Hills overlooking the clear blue sea of Studland Bay.\r\nBuilding on the success of our renowned Fossil Fuel under the expert guidance of master brewer Dan Thomasson, Jack, Pippa and the IOPB team have grown the range to 5 core beers, encompassing a delicious spectrum of styles and tastes.\r\nOur approach to making the beer has always been straightforward.

The youngest of six in a family of caterers, he may have it in his genes to provide others with food and drink, and the early experiments proved a hit at weekly parties on Missoula's University Avenue. Dan tried his hand at the homebrew standards--stouts, porters, English-style ales, etc.--but also made a mean hefeweizen (no lemon, please), alt, marzen, dunkel, and other Continental styles. Since moving to Portland in 2001, he's quenched the thirst of friends, neighbors and guests--not just college partygoers but beer geeks who live in Beervana for a reason.

He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the 'natural philosophy' that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.\r\n\r\nBecause of this 'philosophy of mead', Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!

Of course we all know that those pirates who roamed the seas were a nasty lot.  But they certainly did enjoy large amounts of good grog!  We also celebrate those few women who took to the seas to join the men who thirsted for booty.  They were as fierce as the men!

Linus and Lila Hall moved to Nashville from Mississippi in 1996, with Linus going to work as a tire engineer for Bridgestone and Lila as a curator for the Parthenon. Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery. Yazoo Brewing opened for business in Oct 2003, and quickly gained an enthusiastic local following.","website":"http://www.yazoobrew.com/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gUJBgl/upload_P8vokp-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gUJBgl/upload_P8vokp-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gUJBgl/upload_P8vokp-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2012-10-22 13:20:04","locations":[{"id":"preZog","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"910 Division St","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","phone":"615-891-4649","website":"http://www.yazoobrew.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nWednesday are Growler fills only","latitude":36.1509754,"longitude":-86.7821302,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2003","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-08-23 15:00:53","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
