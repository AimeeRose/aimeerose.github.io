For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...\"\r\n\r\nThe word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales. \r\nWell, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing.

Fortunately for beer lovers in North Texas, Fritz not only fell in love with Fort Worth, but also fell in love with his future wife here. And in another fortuitous twist for all of us, Fritz’s wife, Erin, gave him the thumbs up when he announced that he would like to carry on the Rahr family tradition of brewing.\r\n\r\nFritz and Erin founded Rahr & Sons Brewing Co. in the fall of 2004. In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.","website":"http://www.rahrbrewery.com/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_q2wS2m-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_q2wS2m-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_q2wS2m-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-31 11:14:52","locations":[{"id":"X6U0o8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 Galveston Avenue","locality":"Fort Worth","region":"Texas","postalCode":"76104","phone":"817-810-9266","website":"http://www.rahrbrewery.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:5:00 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat:1:00 pm - 3:00 pm","latitude":32.7368128,"longitude":-97.3275585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-10-29 16:04:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"tnvnBm","name":"Red Hill Brewery","description":"Red Hill Brewery is a unique beer and food experience on the Mornington Peninsula.

Owner/Brewers Nick Anderson and Dan Chang started the company in 2004 with the help of a third partner, Robbie Stair after relocating to Minneapolis from Seattle. Robbie owned a farm in scenic Maiden Rock, WI just above the confluence of the Rush River and Lake Pepin. After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals. Our small size still allows us to experiment with new styles, while the larger capacity for brewing and storage keep our regular brands flowing out the door.","website":"http://www.rushriverbeer.com","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wpQqy4/upload_seaXqD-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wpQqy4/upload_seaXqD-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wpQqy4/upload_seaXqD-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2013-05-08 12:39:21","locations":[{"id":"hHD54O","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"990 Antler Court","locality":"River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54022","phone":"1-715-426-2054","latitude":44.8902357,"longitude":-92.6377675,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"UMdKmQ","name":"Schlossplatz Brauerei Cöpenick","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:36","updateDate":"2012-08-13 14:27:40","locations":[{"id":"HfeiMv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Auf dem Schlossplatz / Grünstraße","locality":"Köpenick","region":"Berlin","postalCode":"D-12555","latitude":52.460945,"longitude":13.58243,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:46:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"QDEmHZ","name":"Schwalenberger Brauzunft","website":"http://www.schwalenberger-brauzunft.de/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:09","updateDate":"2012-08-13 00:38:21","locations":[{"id":"1WSZAu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"In der Tränke 8","locality":"Schieder-Schwalenberg","region":"North Rhine-Westphalia","postalCode":"32816","latitude":51.913784,"longitude":9.155275,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:48:14","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"Oj9rBb","name":"Short's Brewing Company","description":"In April of 2004 we opened the doors to Short’s Brewing Company in the quaint Village of Bellaire.
