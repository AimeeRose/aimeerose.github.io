The idea of making a mini brewery came from two people in Árskogssandur, the couple Agnes Anna and Olafur Trostur, after Agnes saw a small news report on Icelandic television. The report was about growing popularity of small breweries in Denmark, and a week later they were in Denmark to see breweries. Early in 2006 they found investers and today there are 15 individuals who share 44% of the company, and Agnes and Olafur own 56%.\r\n\r\nThe idea for Agnes and Olafur was to make a new brand of beer to sell, and they only wanted to make a beer which had high quality and rich taste, so they chose to use a Czech tradition beacause beers from Czech Republic are known for their good quality. Agnes and Olafur had two options of making the beer, they could either find a beer that they liked and buy the recipe and make the beer in Iceland, or make the choice they did. They hired a brewmaster named David Masa, a brewmaster from Czech and he has studied brewing for 9 years but the standard education is 4 years. They made their own beer from their ideas of good beer. They decided to make high quality beer, and use only the best raw materials they could get. They get all the materials from Czech Republic exept of course the Icelandic fresh water wich they get from a mountain in Arskogssandur.\r\n\r\nThe outcome  is Kaldi. An Icelandic beer, brewed by a Czech recipe and has only the best materials. The beer has no added sugar or any preservatives, an Kaldi is not pasteurized. All this makes Kaldi as fresh and healthy as he can possibly be.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning Kaldi was producedin 170.000 lt. per year. But due to very good sale of the beer and lot of requests , they had to add fermentation tanks and after that, Kaldi was produced in 300.000 lt. per year.\r\n\r\n Bruggsmidjan now produces Kaldi, Kaldi dark, Kaldi lite and Gullfoss.","website":"http://www.bruggsmidjan.is/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-08 12:24:09","updateDate":"2012-10-08 12:48:17"},{"id":"9BPs2d","name":"Butternuts Beer and Ale","description":"Established in 2005, Butternuts Beer and Ale is located on a 120-acre farm in the beautiful Butternut Valley.

The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles on the shelf. However, even “cheap” was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn’t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless steel tanks with beer. \r\n\r\nThe scrape-together building and used equipment model was then blacked out from the “Phase 1” section of the business plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won’t likely fix our present model. \r\n\r\nSo that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the “hate” column—ant that’s always one that someone else places in the “love” column with a glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.","website":"http://www.furthermorebeer.com/","established":"2005","mailingListUrl":"http://www.furthermorebeer.com/mailing-list","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_dFOuLs-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_dFOuLs-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_dFOuLs-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2012-05-30 12:33:14","locations":[{"id":"SY2b6E","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"525 East Madison Street","extendedAddress":"PO Box 776","locality":"Spring Green","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53588","phone":"608-588-3300","website":"http://www.furthermorebeer.com/","latitude":43.18111,"longitude":-90.072391,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"IMpk5G","name":"Gasthausbrauerei Stiftsscheuer","website":"http://www.stiftsscheuer.de/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:15","updateDate":"2012-08-13 11:23:09","locations":[{"id":"hzZvpC","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"Widerholtstrasse 6 - 8","locality":"Kirchheim - Teck","region":"Baden-Württemberg","postalCode":"73230","latitude":48.649021,"longitude":9.452244,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:46:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"k3vBvk","name":"Gella's Diner & Lb.
