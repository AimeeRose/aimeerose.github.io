They decided that brewing a good beer for a great country was what they wanted to do the most.\r\n\r\nWhen 961 Beer officially began brewing they were one of the smallest breweries in the world, and the only microbrewery in the Middle East (and still are).

Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, “What would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?” With Nikos’ background in finance and Jamie’s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose—through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently—within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them—a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi—the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation—was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other—a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene’s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi’s culture continues to embody\r\n“Believe in the Goddess”—symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its\r\nFlagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,\r\nand R&D Series.","website":"http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2013-11-01 11:44:26","locations":[{"id":"KzHweV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"272 Van Buren St","locality":"Eugene","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97402","phone":"877-7-NINKASI","website":"http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/","latitude":44.056855,"longitude":-123.10988,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"WwE6W1","name":"Oakshire Brewing Company","description":"The name Oakshire represents Strength, Independence, Community, values held by our owners and employees.

Our goal is to produce uniquely American beer styles that are imbued with a spirit of invention and creativity, but always with a nod toward history.","website":"http://www.telegraphbrewing.com/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ExxQt6/upload_vcsS5x-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ExxQt6/upload_vcsS5x-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ExxQt6/upload_vcsS5x-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-25 19:08:18","locations":[{"id":"ocMbde","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"418 North Salsipuedes Street","locality":"Santa Barbara","region":"California","postalCode":"93103","phone":"805-963-5398","website":"http://www.telegraphbrewing.com/","latitude":34.422903,"longitude":-119.687689,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-25 18:37:45","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"9x7wNn","name":"The Lost Abbey","description":"Founded in 2006, Port Brewing and The Lost Abbey produce an extensive line-up of continental and American- inspired ales and lagers.

It would take 21 years for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The spark would come after 9/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful “Twin Lakes Farm” in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam’s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed’s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes beer is available on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware and Southeastern Pennsylvania. Growlers (half gallon jugs of beer) can be purchased at the brewery and kegs are available at most regional beer and liquor stores.","website":"http://twinlakesbrewingcompany.com/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VcP5iA/upload_AT5fnN-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VcP5iA/upload_AT5fnN-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VcP5iA/upload_AT5fnN-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2012-04-21 12:38:05","locations":[{"id":"1k3h3N","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4210 Kennett Pike","locality":"Greenville","region":"Delaware","postalCode":"19807","phone":"302-658-1826","website":"http://twinlakesbrewingcompany.com/","latitude":39.785885,"longitude":-75.602527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"OKp2GJ","name":"Vins Arista","description":"Arista Wines, a division of A.
