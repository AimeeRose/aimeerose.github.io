His grandmother, Käthe Schwichtenberg, ran the DEGRAA am Hansemann – better known as the “Os Oche” – for over 25 years. His great grandmother, Katharina Vonderbank, née Degraa, was the head of Josef Degraa Erben KG until her death; Josef Degraa Erben KG had been founded by her father, Josef Degraa, in 1888.\r\n\r\nEver since that time, the DEGRAA brand has been well known, even beyond Germany’s borders.","website":"http://www.degraa.com","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/tiuxoF/upload_9KDyn6-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/tiuxoF/upload_9KDyn6-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/tiuxoF/upload_9KDyn6-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-15 14:34:14","updateDate":"2012-12-15 14:37:45","locations":[{"id":"uLYwtl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Süsterfeldstr. 21","locality":"Aachen","region":"Rhineland-Pfalz","postalCode":"52072","phone":"+49 (0)241-89463100","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  9:00am - 6:00pm\nTue:  9:00am - 6:00pm\nWed:  9:00am - 6:00pm\nThu:  9:00am - 6:00pm\nFri:  9:00am - 6:00pm\nSat:  9:00am - 2:00pm\n\n","latitude":50.8247238,"longitude":6.0440697,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-15 14:37:35","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:38:45","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"dleKhW","name":"Abashiri Beer","website":"http://www.takahasi.co.jp","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dleKhW/upload_75ZnW0-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dleKhW/upload_75ZnW0-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dleKhW/upload_75ZnW0-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-21 16:39:09","updateDate":"2014-11-22 12:27:14","locations":[{"id":"J6OPsX","name":"Abashiri Beer","streetAddress":"4-1-2 Minami Nijo Nishi","locality":"Abashiri","region":"Hokkaido","postalCode":"093-0012","latitude":44.0213648,"longitude":144.2605994,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"JP","status":"new_unverified","statusDisplay":"New, Unverified","createDate":"2014-11-20 23:42:09","updateDate":"2014-11-20 23:42:10","country":{"isoCode":"JP","name":"JAPAN","displayName":"Japan","isoThree":"JPN","numberCode":392,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"M4K0XQ","name":"AC Golden Brewing Company","description":"The AC Golden Brewing Company is a subsidiary of MillerCoors, a joint venture between SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company.

After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking.

With a focus on the revival of artisan brewing, we strive to create the highest quality products available.\r\n\r\nBrewing techniques as timeless as beer itself are used to create a uniquely handmade product. We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a “living, breathing” product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures, it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches. We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice the complexities of the aroma, the silkiness of its body, and the explosion of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble hops blended meticulously for each variety. Join us in celebrating the pleasures of hand crafted beers and life in the Queen City finally merged into this moment in time and allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying a uniquely Charlotte experience.","website":"http://fourfriendsbrewing.com/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hcCgPK/upload_XaEKBW-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hcCgPK/upload_XaEKBW-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hcCgPK/upload_XaEKBW-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:11","locations":[{"id":"amIfT7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10913 C Office Park Drive","locality":"Charlotte","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28273","website":"http://fourfriendsbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Saturday: 3pm - 7pm","latitude":35.12048,"longitude":-80.9595499,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","yearClosed":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"fib7Lb","name":"Good People Brewing Company","description":"Like most real brewers, Good People started out with humble beginnings and no intention of ever starting a business. A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It’s pretty fun to have someone you don’t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn’t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n“Once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right” Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company….to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process….but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems.

The story goes, Wesley was approached by his father, Tim, one day about what he was going to do with his life. As an ocean lifeguard and co-owner of a bar, Wesley thought he had it made. His dad informed him of a trademark he had won in 2004 and subsequently protected in contest from Anheuser Busch. The name was TailGate Beer.\r\n\r\nTim thought TailGate Beer was something special. As an avid sports fan and tailgater, Tim implored Wesley to take his homebrews that people loved drinking and brew TailGate Beer! Wesley, having put himself through college at San Diego State University, grew up modestly. The gift of TailGate Beer was a generous one but, unlike some tales of entrepreneurism, didn’t come with startup funds.\r\n\r\nThey both agreed the name was solid and the marketing would one day be fun, but Wesley was emphatic that the beer had to be excellent. From there, Wesley took what he liked to brew, and brewed in Southern California. All initial beers were brewed and packaged in kegs and glass bottles. Wesley entered into the Great American Beer Festival in 2007 and although no formal awards were won, TailGate Beer was a hit! This drew lots of attention from beer fans from all over the country. The common response was “great beer!” and “great name!” So with confirmation of Wesley’s biggest apprehension – people loved the beer – TailGate Beer was born.","website":"http://www.tailgatebeer.com/","established":"2007","mailingListUrl":"http://tailgatebeer.com/tailgate-newsletter/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2013-08-16 01:31:05","locations":[{"id":"XqWTM7","name":"TailGate Beer","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","phone":"858-215-4842","website":"http://www.tailgatebeer.com","latitude":32.7153292,"longitude":-117.1572551,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"0KVoaE","name":"Tallgrass Brewing Company","description":"The decision to found Tallgrass Brewing Company was made by Jeff Gill and his wife Tricia on April 8, 2006.

Its owners, the husband-and-wife team of Peter Ausenhus and Margaret Bishop, have lived near Northwood since their purchase of a nearby farmhouse and acreage in 1998. Nebraska natives, Peter and Margaret lived and worked in Minneapolis for many years before moving to Worth County, where Peter’s grandparents had lived and farmed and where Peter had spent much time as a boy.\r\n\r\n Having already established Margaret’s engineering business in downtown Northwood, the couple turned next to Peter’s passion – brewing great beer. For 24 years, Peter has brewed award-winning beer, winning contests, teaching others and perfecting classic recipes along the way. He’s a BJCP National Beer Judge, has brewed professionally with Summit Brewing Company of St. Paul, Minn., and worked on staff at one of the country’s most popular brewing supply shops.\r\n\r\nWorth Brewing Company is Peter and Margaret’s way of helping to reintroduce a great tradition – the locally owned brewery serving hand-crafted, high-quality, distinctive beers for the enjoyment of locals and lucky visitors. The nation’s small and mid-sized towns were once dotted with such breweries. Today, Worth Brewing – perhaps one of the world’s smallest craft brewers – brings a bit of those days back to delight the growing number of those who appreciate fine, locally brewed beers.","website":"http://www.worthbrewing.com/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/5hWjSw/upload_Khe2DC-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/5hWjSw/upload_Khe2DC-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/5hWjSw/upload_Khe2DC-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:18","locations":[{"id":"Z5oRX9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"826 Central Ave","locality":"Northwood","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50459","phone":"641-324-4991","website":"http://www.worthbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Tap Room Hours: \r\nWed: 5 to 9 p.m.\r\nFri: 5 to 11 p.m.\r\nSat: noon to 11 p.m.","latitude":43.444055,"longitude":-93.220486,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]
