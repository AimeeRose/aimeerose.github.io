The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming. Our sincere hope is that you – the fan of COOP Ale Works – will take pride in the beers, as if they were your own. Thank you for your unwavering support and encouragement!","website":"http://www.coopaleworks.com/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cKudBu/upload_km3zha-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cKudBu/upload_km3zha-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cKudBu/upload_km3zha-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-09-24 13:28:12","locations":[{"id":"bfPDGk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4745 Council Heights Rd.","locality":"Oklahoma City","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"73179","phone":"405-842-2667","website":"http://www.coopaleworks.com/","latitude":35.4185963,"longitude":-97.6571658,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-09-25 20:04:12","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"YPpErH","name":"Corsaire","website":"http://www.corsairemicro.com/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-03 15:35:27","updateDate":"2013-07-04 13:09:51","locations":[{"id":"2obyBa","name":"Corsaire","streetAddress":"5955, rue Saint-Laurent","extendedAddress":"local 101","locality":"Lévis","region":"Québec","postalCode":"g6v3p5","phone":"1-418-380-2505","website":"http://www.corsairemicro.com/","latitude":46.8105881,"longitude":-71.1869705,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-03 15:38:39","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"BirFEL","name":"Cosmic Ales","description":"Brewing a truly cosmic beer.\r\nWe are committed to brewing true flavors of beer that satisfy every taste bud.","website":"http://cosmicbrewery.com/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BirFEL/upload_0FHh5t-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BirFEL/upload_0FHh5t-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BirFEL/upload_0FHh5t-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:19","locations":[{"id":"aLaCSt","name":"Main Brewery","phone":"424-259-2337","website":"http://cosmicbrewery.com/","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"Rg7sL4","name":"Craft Brew Alliance, Inc.","description":"Craft Brew Alliance was formed with the merger of leading Pacific Northwest craft brewers – Widmer Brothers Brewing and Redhook Ale Brewery – in 2008.

Both had an entrepanerial passion, but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  \"The decision was made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.

While your \"good\" nature will definitely be aroused by this cool, spirit-raising refreshment, your inner evil will soon begin to feel less inhibited, allowing initial laughter and fun to soon require an internal battle of self-restraint.\r\n\r\nHistory - Since the dawn of mankind, we have struggled with the battle of good and evil. To drown in guilt or sorrow is unhealthy and seen by some as wasted emotions. In opposition, to live our lives completely without impure influence and to be seen by all as “up-tight” without the ability to cut loose on occasion is viewed in equally a negative fashion. Until now, there has never been a respectable or enjoyable solution to this life long struggle.\r\nHolyBrew is a positive channel for cleansing one’s mind, body and spirit of unwanted or unnecessary guilt, doubt or unhappiness.

One was an engineer toiling away on the super computers of a local university, and the other was a supervisor managing the complex operations of a local billionaire. Both of them loved their jobs, but more than their jobs they loved beer. Each Don had a recurring dream of a magical place without a name, a place where the great beers of the world flowed like the Salmon le Sac at flood stage, and the fine brewing tradition of the Pacific Northwest stood proudly beside the best concoctions from far-flung breweries in Asia and across Europe.\r\n\r\nDon and Donald worked tirelessly in the wee hours on their home brew mixtures, searching for the best possible combination of hops, malt, barley, and love. For long years, the two Dons had their separate dreams, and never met. A local poet named Bryan had the pleasure of growing up with Donald, and worked for the same local billionaire as Don. After many months of hearing Don speak of his dream of the magical beer haven, Bryan knew it must be the very same place of which Donald had spoken too. He knew instinctively that it was his responsibility to bring the two Dons together. On a fateful summer afternoon at the Elysian Brewery on Capitol Hill, the two Dons met. The event later became known as THE HAPPY HOUR OF DESTINY.\r\n\r\nEvery patron in the pub knew something special was happening that day. The magical place both men dreamed of was one and the same. That very afternoon, the two Dons vowed to create a great beer haven right here on earth, and together they would name this magic place THE NAKED CITY. In THE NAKED CITY, it doesn't matter where you're going or where you've been, all that matters is great living and great beer. In THE NAKED CITY, the only problem is what great craft beer to try next. The two Dons spent a combined 25 years studying the world's great brewing traditions, and couldn't wait to begin experimenting together. Their very first batch of beer, an Oak-aged double IPA, took a ribbon in the Northwest regionals of the 2007 National Homebrew Competition. The rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the two Dons combined their separate dreams, THE NAKED CITY opened its doors. Now Naked City boasts an award-winning brewery that produces a variety of small-batch beers available at the pub and friendly bars and restaurants in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, and beyond. The 24 taps of THE NAKED CITY offer a constantly rotating variety of Washington's best beers, regional craft beers, and the best beers Donald and Don have found in two lifetimes of beer travels around the world.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half years after THE NAKED CITY was founded, the Dons convinced the local poet who brought them together to join them in the adventure. The Dons and Bryan together built a bigger brewery; a full-size kitchen; a dining room/movie theatre called The Screening Room that features free monthly events including film, comedy, poetry, community discusssion, and jazz; and now The Walrus Beer Garden, a patio that's home to murals by local artists, games, and summertime events.\r\n\r\nSo. Welcome to THE NAKED CITY, where great beer lovers flock like the salmon of Capistrano, and the only question is: WHAT TAP NEXT?","website":"http://www.nakedcitybrewing.com/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WF34ng/upload_s2ninP-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WF34ng/upload_s2ninP-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WF34ng/upload_s2ninP-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-09-18 11:14:39","locations":[{"id":"R59V2j","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8564 Greenwood Ave N","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98103","phone":"206-838-6299","website":"http://www.nakedcitybrewing.com/","latitude":47.691833,"longitude":-122.35509,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"l7He1U","name":"Napa Smith Brewery","description":"We create our beers using proprietary recipes developed by our Master Brewer Don Barkley, with his 30+ years in the craft brewing industry.
