The area was “16 miles from anywhere” in the county and was the best place for farmers, merchants, and politicians to meet to conduct official business. Georgetown replaced Lewes as the County Seat when numerous petitions were sent to Delaware’s General Assembly requesting that the move be made to accommodate all county residents.

With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the \"Back 40\" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.","website":"http://www.backfortybeer.com/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_Lw3eGZ-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_Lw3eGZ-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_Lw3eGZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2013-03-21 16:54:19","locations":[{"id":"lAcrbq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 North 6th St.","locality":"Gadsden","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35901","phone":"256-467-4912","website":"http://www.backfortybeer.com/","latitude":34.015484,"longitude":-86.005585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Backlash Beer Company","description":"It’s time to stand up against the predictable, old beer establishment and craft beers the way they were intended: flavorful, gimmick free and not produced in ridiculous quantities.

Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new “microbreweries” all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.\r\nUntil 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town’s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery’s demise.\r\nBig Muddy Brewing’s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago’s Rosati’s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.\r\nIt was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.\r\nStuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.\r\nStuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.\r\nThe first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg’s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good “craft beer transition brew” for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).\r\nKinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing’s second selection, “Saluki Dunkel Dog”, a dark, amber/dunkel style beer.\r\nThe third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing’s lineup is an ale called “Big Muddy Pale Ale”, and future varieties include “Logan’s Lager”.","website":"http://www.bigmuddybrewing.com/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2013-04-30 14:46:55","locations":[{"id":"QkdgSV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1430 North 7th Street","locality":"Murphysboro","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"62966","phone":"(618) 684-8833","website":"http://www.bigmuddybrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\r\n`","latitude":37.7823381,"longitude":-89.3321145,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"K4Vn3h","name":"Big Shoulders Beer Company","description":"It started with a love of beer and a homebrewing kit.\r\n\r\nBig Shoulders isn't a big beer company (yet).

Butchers, bakers, farmers and even brewers, made their products for local consumption.\r\n\r\nFounded in 2009, Draai Laag began as a way to introduce beer with creative flavors into the market, offering a bit of variety in a world of Pilsners, Pales Ales and Porters.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we use old world methods, such as bottle conditioning by aging our ales on lees.  We brew in small batches and use several strains of yeast to produce our beers.   The drinker may notice slight nuances from batch to batch.  But, you will find that all our ales are aged and, just like a fine wine, can be laid down for extended periods.   This results in a unique drinking experience each time a bottle is opened.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we like to cater to those that want something respectful of tradition, but ultimately different.  Those who are not satisfied drinking the norm.  Most importantly, we get our biggest enjoyment and fulfillment not from profit, but from your smile after the first sip.\r\n\r\nThis company was built on the dream of doing what we love and following our passion.

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks’ two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm. Brewery tours are given Saturdays at 2pm.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is currently distributed in:\r\nColorado:\r\nAmerican Eagle Distributing and C.R.

You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. \r\nThe promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.\r\n\r\nToday our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.\r\n\r\nWe’re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.\r\nWe have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we grow by 66 and 2/3’s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only local brewery that brews 100% of our beer. We are small but hungry…we mean thirsty.","website":"http://www.harborbrewing.com/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/b15cO3/upload_F15kbe-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/b15cO3/upload_F15kbe-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/b15cO3/upload_F15kbe-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2012-09-18 17:35:05","locations":[{"id":"1irs0u","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"234 Carpenter Street","locality":"Greenport","region":"New York","postalCode":"11944","phone":"631-477-6681","website":"http://www.harborbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Open for Tastings/Growlers/Retail:\r\nFri & Sat 12-7pm\r\nSun 12-6pm","latitude":41.1024718,"longitude":-72.3589459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"A42d5Y","name":"Grönwohlder Hausbrauerei","website":"http://www.groenwohlder.de/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:20:26","updateDate":"2012-08-16 12:56:16","locations":[{"id":"CVl8by","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Poststraße 21","locality":"Grönwohld","postalCode":"22956","latitude":53.639496,"longitude":10.409945,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 12:56:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"0Lhdch","name":"Hermitage Brewing Company","description":"Hermitage Brewing Company (HBC) is a Silicon Valley native.

We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more ‘sessionable’ in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a ‘spice beer’, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted ‘Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind’.

Brewing Company","description":"Quaff: To drink heartily and with gusto!\r\n\r\nAt Quaff ON! Brewing Company, 'Gusto' is part of everything we do. Our hand-crafted beers reflect our passion for the brewer's art and our commitment to creating beers that excite and delight the quaffer's palette.\r\nQuaff ON! Brewing Company was formed in 2012 in response to the demand for the iconic craft beers we developed at Big Woods Brewing Company, our brewpub located in the heart of Brown County Indiana. Why 'Quaff ON!'? Because from the day Big Woods threw open its doors in 2009, Quaff ON! has been the rallying cry, the toast, and the salutation of our loyal fans.\r\nWhen Big Woods founders Jeff McCabe, Tim O'Bryan and Ed Ryan decided to create Quaff ON! Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility.\r\nOnce Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago.\r\nCurrently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state. If Quaff ON! is not served at your favorite place, send us a note and we'll get it in there! If you're travelling our way, stop in and see us in Brown County and visit us in Nashville at Big Woods Village where you can enjoy fine craft beer, great food and the best in local entertainment.\r\n\r\n\"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.\" - William Shakespeare","website":"http://www.quaffonbrewing.com/home.html","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_4Y9OeY-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_4Y9OeY-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_4Y9OeY-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-09-29 14:27:49","locations":[{"id":"qZJOHj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"60 Molly Ln","locality":"Nashville","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47448","phone":"813-988-6000","website":"http://www.bigwoodsbeer.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thur: 11:30am - 9pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30am - 10pm\r\nSun: 11:30am - 9pm","latitude":39.2079575,"longitude":-86.2484171,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"DWjwcm","name":"Rivertown Brewing Company","description":"Welcome to the Rivertown Brewing Company, We specialize in brewing traditional Handcrafted Lagers and Ales, using only the finest and freshest ingredients available.  use the buttons to the left to find out \"What Ales You\"!","website":"http://rivertownbrewery.com/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DWjwcm/upload_lZNV3Y-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DWjwcm/upload_lZNV3Y-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DWjwcm/upload_lZNV3Y-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2013-08-09 17:01:19","locations":[{"id":"eKF3uv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"607 Shepherd Drive #6","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45215","phone":"513-827-9280","website":"http://rivertownbrewery.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:        4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nThu:         5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri:\t5:00 pm -10:00 pm\r\nSat:\t2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":39.236015,"longitude":-84.462885,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"larXrM","name":"Ruckus Brewing Company","description":"Ruckus Brewing Company brews products of exceptional quality, re-invigorates brands of historical significance, and services a growing craft brew market with products that satisfy the most discerning pallets.\"\r\n\r\nWith Ruckus Brewing you’ll find a commitment to produce high-quality, full-flavored beer by applying both European and American brewing processes.

We have had a fantastic time making mead and meeting mead drinkers from all over the world, and now its our turn to share our love of mead with all of you!\r\n\r\nBecky Starr, Owner, Sales/Tasting Room Manager\r\nBen Starr, Owner, Wine/Meadmaker\r\n\r\nWe first discovered mead in CA at the Southern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire. Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association’s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our “Starrlight Mulled Apple Cyser” was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.\r\n\r\nBen shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community. We also organize and conduct the local Mead Day celebration each August (since 2005) and are a key part of the product tasting team for mead reviews on Gotmead.com. Becky worked with Chatham Hill Winery for 2 years learning tasting room and wine club management. We are members of the Chatham County Beekeepers Association, and the NC Winegrowers Association.","website":"http://starrlightmead.com","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hdz6Zk/upload_lvyIUz-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hdz6Zk/upload_lvyIUz-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hdz6Zk/upload_lvyIUz-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-27 15:30:02","updateDate":"2013-06-27 15:34:55","locations":[{"id":"XPKDbB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"480 Hillsboro Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 1000","locality":"Pittsboro","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27312","phone":"919-533-6314","website":"http://starrlightmead.com","hoursOfOperation":"Regular Hours\r\nThursdays and Fridays from noon til 6 pm\r\n\r\nSaturdays from noon til 6 pm\r\nMeadery tours at 1 pm, 3 pm & 5 pm.\r\n\r\nSundays from 1 pm til 5 pm\r\nMeadery tours at 2 pm & 4 pm.","latitude":35.7269418,"longitude":-79.1752021,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-27 15:32:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"5bK52w","name":"Steadfast Beer Company","description":"Steadfast Beer Co. proudly produces delicious, Gluten-Free craft beer!

Why is he Wicked, you may ask? He is Wicked from the ways of the world, so many demands, too many deadlines, minor appreciation, and never enough time. So with little more than the stick in his hand and the Hops in his hanker chief, he journeyed West. Upon arriving in the West he hopped from the tailgate, choked on the dust, and kicked a tumble weed rolling his direction. This is the West, the place full of opportunity “he asked himself” and sighed but after a few Wicked Cold months, the landscape began to change, grass became lush green, trees bloomed and the flowers opened. The Wicked Beaver found the warm days, and cool nights were perfect to pursue his passion.\r\n\r\nThe Wicked Beaver and his brewing partners have been Brewing Craft Specialty Beer’s in secret for years, perfecting the fragrant aroma by blending only best hops and hand selecting the Malted Barley for the most unique varieties of flavors and textures.
