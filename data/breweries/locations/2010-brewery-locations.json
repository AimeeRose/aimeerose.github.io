Tom’s California beer-drinking youth provided him with a strong affinity for the pioneers of micro-brewing, back when Sierra Nevada, Pete’s Wicked, and Mendocino Brewing were small craft brewers. Decades of drinking beer – and specifically micro-brews – have contributed to Tom’s brewing pedigree. (Or so he says.)

So, for the first four years Barley and Vine was making 5-gallon extract batches.  Barley and Vine began sharing the beers with friends and family looking for input and making corrections and changes when needed.  As time went by the brewing skill level and quality of the beer continued to improve.   Changing from 5-gallon extract batched to 10 gallon all-grain batches made a huge difference in the quality of the final product.\r\n\r\nBarley and Vine is a nano brewery in the planning.  As we continue to build our business plan, determine a location, and perfect our recipes and processes we will do our best to keep people up to speed through this website, Facebook, and our blog.

In the mountains of Tennessee gathered a very small group of friends and family including Jason’s cousin Kymberly and her then boyfriend Jamie Robinson. After an intimate ceremony, the entire group enjoyed a reception complete with homemade guacamole and a tub full of crudely marked “homebrews” prepared by Jason. Prior to this, he had been working in high-end restaurants as a general manager, bartender and food server for over 20 years. He spent several years in Northern California learning the fine art of winemaking at a local winery in Sonoma. During this time Jason realized the beauty of brewing beer and his desire to share his creation(s) with others. He’s been brewing out of his kitchen sink for several years now, slowly perfecting his recipes, offering to teach others the art, and, most importantly, making and drinking some real good beer. Jamie, who has yet to find a brew he will not try, immediately was interested in Jason’s creations and quickly started picking his brain on the processes and formalities for creating these “homebrews”. While sucking down a few well-crafted brews in the hot sun, Jamie and Jason talked about their love of beer and the groundwork was laid.\r\n\r\nA few months later, Jamie received a phone call from Jason, who had been mulling over the possibility of moving forward with the beer making, he then proposed the idea of moving to Pennsylvania. Jason asked if Jamie would be interested in working together and the dream of opening a brewery was declared. In 2007, Jason and his wife moved to West Chester, PA where many of his family live. Together with the other three members the idea was hatched to get serious and start brewing beer on a larger scale, for the beer lovers in Chester County, PA. Box Car Brewing Company became a reality.","website":"http://www.boxcarbrewingcompany.com/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PgnRc3/upload_ymsv6f-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PgnRc3/upload_ymsv6f-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PgnRc3/upload_ymsv6f-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2013-02-02 12:42:09","locations":[{"id":"0k2SXz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"306 Westtown Rd","locality":"West Chester","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"19382","phone":"484-887-0538","website":"http://www.boxcarbrewingcompany.com/","latitude":39.9620632,"longitude":-75.5888196,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"VjJmPv","name":"Brainerd Lakes Beer","description":"Brainerd Lakes Beer.

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

The equinox, and the intrigue of equal night and day, has deep roots in history and ritual. But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there’s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple…\r\n\r\nWe find another aspect of beer’s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don’t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.\r\n\r\nOn one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them. We’re not afraid to try new things.\r\n\r\nAs a brewer, its playtime and work, balanced.","website":"http://www.equinoxbrewing.com/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wYyIFx/upload_b1atTK-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wYyIFx/upload_b1atTK-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wYyIFx/upload_b1atTK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:12","locations":[{"id":"YKa9wh","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"133 Remington Street","locality":"Fort Collins","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80524","phone":"970-430-6489","website":"http://www.equinoxbrewing.com/","latitude":40.586331,"longitude":-105.0757067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"gz4uZ6","name":"Erlebnisbrauerei Lohmar","website":"http://www.erlebnisbrauerei-lohmar.de/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:15","updateDate":"2012-08-13 00:36:07","locations":[{"id":"joeSG6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Meigermühle 2","locality":"Lohmar","region":"North Rhine-Westphalia","postalCode":"53797","latitude":50.840903,"longitude":7.211563,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:45:21","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"PdSE1h","name":"Evil Genius Beer Company","description":"The Evil Genius Brewing Company is an Independent Craft Brewery located in Pennsylvania, owned by Luke Bowen, Trevor Hayward, and Mark Braunwarth.

Our mantra is big, bold flavors, made exactingly with natural ingredients. So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you’ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It’s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park’s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida’s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!

Our shared love of food and beer propelled us to start an underground beer tasting movement during which we hosted a series of 7 beer tasting events over the course of a 13 months. We may be the new kids on the Prescott scene, but GMB brings ten years of brewing experience to the table. From the farmlands of Vermont to the mountains of Alaska; the homelands of Idaho and now the high deserts of Prescott! \r\n\r\nGMB opened the doors on the brewery and taproom in August 2012. By small operation, we mean SMALL. Not micro. We're talking about nanobrewing here, folks. We're a grassroots endeavor that began in a garage and garnered fast support from the community. \r\n\r\nWe pride ourselves on high-quality unpretentious beer. We like to brew traditional styles as well as creative twists on the traditional. Inspired by the local landscape and community, we look forward to experimenting with local ingredients (wheat berries, juniper berries, prickly pear fruit) and becoming part of the local flavor of Prescott. Beer education is part of what we do: styles, processes, ingredients, and the magical pairing between beer and food. Why? Because this is all part of celebrating the simpler things in life: good food, good friends, good beer.","website":"http://www.granitemountainbrewing.com/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qtLQ7F/upload_LWdiOR-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qtLQ7F/upload_LWdiOR-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qtLQ7F/upload_LWdiOR-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-02 18:20:13","updateDate":"2013-03-02 18:21:56","locations":[{"id":"wI1wn8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"123 N Cortez St","locality":"Prescott","region":"Arizona","postalCode":"86301","phone":"(928) 778-5535","website":"http://www.granitemountainbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":34.5427831,"longitude":-112.4686784,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-02 18:21:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"65NldW","name":"Gravity Brewing","description":"Louisville Colorado's Craft Brewery.

Chris is not out to change the US craft beer world, but to simply brew the beers he loves to drink, and he thinks he is not alone.\r\n\r\nChris has been brewing professionally since 1993, first as an apprentice at Kennebunkport Brewing, then at the Tremont Brewery in Boston MA starting in 1994. Today, Chris is an independent brewer – he owns no facility – instead brewing and collaborating with other breweries. He currently brews his beers at two locations, the Ipswich Ale Brewery (Bottles & Draft) and Kennebunkport Brewery (Cask).","website":"http://www.notchsession.com/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/a0ab7x/upload_bx6MR5-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/a0ab7x/upload_bx6MR5-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/a0ab7x/upload_bx6MR5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:12","locations":[{"id":"GDFP48","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"23 Hayward St.","locality":"Ipswich","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01938","phone":"978-853-9138","website":"http://www.notchsession.com/","latitude":42.672726,"longitude":-70.843912,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"eRdXNO","name":"NW Peaks Brewery","description":"NW Peaks Brewery is a \"nano-brewery\" located in Ballard. As a nano-brewery, we make less than one barrel of beer per batch and therefore cannot produce nearly the quantity as other breweries around. It also means that we can afford to brew many different styles of beer in smaller quantities with attention to traditional styles and creative \"experiments\". Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer. However, the best received ones will get duplicated (but not that often) and quite possibly may become flagship beers down the line.","website":"http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eRdXNO/upload_SVLiaS-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eRdXNO/upload_SVLiaS-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eRdXNO/upload_SVLiaS-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2012-04-15 18:44:27","locations":[{"id":"PG4ybp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4912 17th Avenue Northwest","extendedAddress":"Suite B","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98107","phone":"206-853-0525","latitude":47.664834,"longitude":-122.378656,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"CwxOMu","name":"Odd Side Ales","description":"​Welcome to Odd Side Ales, one of the fastest growing breweries in Michigan.

The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing—it was love at first smell.\r\n\r\nPSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During “Brew Nights,” friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities.

Joleen and Brian Durham, owners, have lived and farmed in Texas County for many years, and they have enjoyed craft beer for a long time, too.\r\n\r\nToday, Joleen and Brian live up the hill from the Little Piney River that flows into the Big Piney.  They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks.\r\n\r\nJoleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house.  In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nThe barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a “nanobrewery”, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.  In the fall of 2011, a 7-barrel brewhouse with an automatic canning line was put in place for the microbrewery.\r\n\r\nInsane?...No, we're having the time of our lives!","website":"http://www.pineyriverbrewing.com/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H1ouEw/upload_aPVa9e-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H1ouEw/upload_aPVa9e-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H1ouEw/upload_aPVa9e-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2013-10-08 18:57:09","locations":[{"id":"TKwUTr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15194 Walnut Grove Drive","locality":"Bucyrus","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"65444","phone":"417-967-6786","website":"http://www.pineyriverbrewing.com/","latitude":37.3208964,"longitude":-92.0165208,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"BumlJd","name":"Public House Brewing Co","description":"In 2010, Josh & Beth Stacy and Josh & Trisha Goodridge--longtime\r\nfriends--opened Public House Brewing Company in Rolla, MO, the town's first brewpub.  But it was a long, long time in the works.  Like any business, there were big ups and downs on the road to the first pour and we think that story is worth sharing.  So here goes....\r\n \r\nJosh Stacy grew up like any other kid in America, playing music, sports, and sharing his space with two siblings.  Totally normal--with one exception.  His father, Steven Stacy, was an award-winning home brewer.  Steve was brewing world class beers in his kitchen before most people had even heard of the hobby.\r\nJosh grew up thinking every kid helped their dad bottle homemade beer on Saturday mornings before they could watch cartoons.   \r\nFast-forward a few years.  Stacy and Goodridge meet in junior high, become fast friends, and begin playing music together (and have been ever since).  Even more years went by.  Between the two there were graduations, marriages, children, careers, and beer.  Yes, beer.  At some point (memories are fuzzy) Stacy introduced Goodridge to drinking real, full-flavored craft beers.  It wasn't long before he introduced Goodridge to brewing real, full-flavored craft beers.  Goodridge was hooked.  \r\n\r\nMany weekends were spent in the Stacy home garage milling grain, mashing in, adding hops, and pitching yeast.  The two took in as much of Steve Stacy's brewing knowledge as possible, brewing good beer and having a couple pints throughout the brew day.  That always loosened the tongue.  Next would inevitably come the conversation about taking this hobby to the next level.  \r\n\r\nGoodridge heard this conversation more times than he can remember.  On a Sunday afternoon while leisurely enjoying a fine craft beer at home with his wife Trisha, he got a wild idea.  Enough was enough, he told her.  He immediately called Stacy and said, \"I'm coming over to your house.\"  Goodridge passionately pleaded his case to Josh and Beth.  \"Rolla needs fresh craft beer and we're the guys for the job.\" \r\n\r\nJosh Stacy wasn't a hard sell as he had always truly wanted to do this, but now they needed help from their wives to make this dream happen.  Thankfully, these wonderful ladies agreed to take the plunge and the four embarked on the treacherous journey together to bring fresh craft beer to Rolla.  Many trials and triumphs later, Public House Brewing Company opened its doors on December 16th, 2010, to a very thirsty populous. \r\n\r\nOne week later, all the beer they had made was gone.  It was\r\na hit!  The Rolla area embraced its first and only craft brewpub and put Public House on the map.  Now the Stacys and Goodridges are fulfilling their dream of bringing hand-crafted beers of the highest quality to Mid-Missouri.  You are invited to come in and have a pint with us.  Cheers!\r\n \r\nNow that you know our story, we encourage you to come in and share yours.

That means Euopean styles, but with a slight Southern interpretation.\r\nThanks to Free the Hops and the change in Alabama's formerly restrictive beer laws, creativity in brewing has come to Alabama.\r\n\r\nAt Yellowhammer, head brewer Keith Yager draws inspiration from both Belgian and German brewing traditions. An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA. Other staples sold throughout the year include a German style altbier and the Miracle Worker, a potent Belgian tripel.","website":"http://www.yellowhammerbrewery.com/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BI8mE7/upload_h0FCyk-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BI8mE7/upload_h0FCyk-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BI8mE7/upload_h0FCyk-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2012-10-22 13:21:58","locations":[{"id":"4V6C7Y","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2406 Clinton Avenue","locality":"West Huntsville","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35805","phone":"256-975-5950","website":"http://www.yellowhammerbrewery.com/","latitude":34.722525,"longitude":-86.603703,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"lD0Vgm","name":"Zauber Brewing Company","description":"Zauber Brewing Co is a new start up MicroBrewery in Columbus, OH.
