[{"id":"XYOIqp","name":"14th Star Brewing","description":"History books tell us that local Vermonter and beer enthusiast Ethan Allen was a leader inthe effort to make Vermont the fourteenth star on the U.S. flag in 1791. And those textbooks are right; especially about the 1791 part.\r\n\r\nToday, in Franklin County, Vermont, Army veteran Steve Gagner is honoring his home state and passion – brewing great beer – with 14th Star Brewing Co.\r\n\r\n14th Star is Steve’s 1,200-square-foot nanobrewery on Lower Newton Street, in St. Albans City.\r\n\r\nNanobreweries make less than four-barrel batches, and as of your eyes hitting this paragraph, there are still less than 100 nanobreweries in America.\r\n\r\nWhat makes 14th Star stand out? Well, it’s about the only brewery in Vermont that’s located above Burlington. Period.\r\n\r\nBut that’s not it. Not entirely.\r\n\r\nYou see – this is your beer. Oh, sure, Steve plans on starting you off with one-barrel batches of pale ale, brown ale, and Belgian white. There will be more, of course, but that’s up to you. So tell Steve what style beer you want in your 14th Star growler at: steve@14thstarbrewing.com.\r\nOn our end, we are readying to open our doors. Our goal is this July. (Check out our Pint of Progress on our home page.)\r\n\r\nWe can’t wait to watch you let your hair down and lift your glass, Vermont. We’ll enjoy that. And remember – this is your beer. You enjoy it.","website":"http://www.14thstarbrewing.com/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/XYOIqp/upload_bILhvF-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/XYOIqp/upload_bILhvF-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/XYOIqp/upload_bILhvF-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-10 23:32:11","updateDate":"2012-10-10 23:33:52","locations":[{"id":"G5N8qx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"41 Lower Newton Street","locality":"Saint Albans","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05478","phone":"(802) 393-1459","website":"http://www.14thstarbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  5:00pm - 9:00pm\nFri:  5:00pm - 9:00pm\nSun:  9:00am - 12:00pm\n\n","latitude":44.8201794,"longitude":-73.0852061,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-10 23:33:21","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:38:17","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"eSpMPr","name":"4 Hands Brewing Company","description":"4 Hands Brewing Company, located in the LaSalle Park neighborhood, will provide the craft beer enthusiast a handcrafted portfolio inspired by the American craft movement that pushes the limits of creativity.

He started very small, but is now growing at an unbelieveable pace, thanks to a lot of hard work finally paying off and a lot of prayers being answered.   Says Mike: \"Initially, I decided to make everything from scratch because I couldn't afford to buy whatI needed.  Once I made a 1932 yellow deuce coupe in my garage and it became a beautiful running hot rod.  A buddy of mine told me \"If I could do that, then I could make a brewery come true!\"  That really stuck with me.  Little Area 51 Craft Brewery takes a chance in a worldwide market and it was a good choice according to an ever growing popularity.  Why Alien Head Beer? Earthly beers are brewed somewhat similar ways and have a common process.  Alien Head Beer is actually brewed in a special process that is unlike other breweries and delivers a taste that is out of this world!  \"We're already thinking ahead and out of the box of what may come next.

This majestic white oak stands in the middle of where the road would have gone, if not for this tree’s historical significance.  If you look closely at the trunk of this old oak, you will notice the mark of an equal armed cross carved into its bark. The cross was carved sometime between 1775 and 1776 when Spanish Lt. Colonel Juan Batista de Anza led more than 240 men, women and children on an overland journey from the frontier New Spain to settle in Alta California. During that 1,200 mile journey, the very thirsty Colonel carved the cross to signify the perfect location for a brewery…well, that’s our story at Barrelhouse and we can’t exactly prove it, but we’re sticking to it!  Historians believe that Juan Batista de Anza or someone on his team carved the cross to indicate a safe place to camp.  We think it makes a sweet logo, too!\r\n\r\nAfter you pass the old oak, make a left on Limestone Way and look for the dragon fly…you can’t miss it. \r\n\r\nStop by, grab a brew or two and relax.  Enjoy our glorious beer gardens with friends while you listen to the waterfall and experience the central coast the way it was meant to be enjoyed…outside.  You can also pull up to the bar inside the brewery where you’ll feel like you’re part of the brewing action. Along with our amazing line-up of beers, we will also feature our very own custom crafted rootbeers.  If you ask nicely, we can even float a scoop of ice cream in your favorite sarsaparilla or stout.","website":"http://www.barrelhousebrewing.com","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http://barrelhousebrewing.us5.list-manage1.com/subscribe/?u=ea30d6d47dfb4ee86877ced94&id=24c2c6c1e3","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rT7yN7/upload_BGEfmi-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rT7yN7/upload_BGEfmi-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rT7yN7/upload_BGEfmi-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-18 13:56:17","updateDate":"2013-08-06 10:56:51","locations":[{"id":"UukHF7","name":"Brewery and Beer Gardens!","streetAddress":"3055 Limestone Way","locality":"Paso Robles","region":"California","postalCode":"93446","phone":"(805) 296-1128","website":"http://www.barrelhousebrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Monday-Tuesday: Closed\r\nWednesday-Thursday: 2-8\r\nFriday-Saturday: 11-9\r\nSunday: 11-8","latitude":35.575975,"longitude":-120.690655,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-18 13:58:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"EhUsAz","name":"Battenkill Brewing Company","description":"Battenkill, or the Battenkill River, is a 50-mile river rising in Vermont that flows into New York and is a tributary of the Hudson River.

We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.

Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http://www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/manage/optin/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_8LAKzQ-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_8LAKzQ-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_8LAKzQ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2012-09-25 18:50:22","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http://www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"4vof7m","name":"Bull Jagger Brewing Company","description":"Focusing on one primary perfect lager, Bull Jagger Brewing Company opened its doors in the Riverside Industrial Park in 2011.

The biggest trend, and subsequent impediment, in craft/micro brewing is the almost obsessive need to make the biggest, hoppiest, strangest beer possible, which is great for advancing the boundaries of what can be done with beer but does not satisfy a daily thirst. We pride ourselves on making great beer, with all the flavor one could want, that people will actually want to drink whenever and with whatever. Again, great doesn’t have to be complicated.\r\n\r\nAnother of our fundamental ideas is that brewing is free, and should be open. So, with this in mind, we will share as many of our “secrets” as possible with everyone so that they too can make great beer at home.

Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about “off the clock” to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.","website":"http://www.geaghanspub.com","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_lnNlJi-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_lnNlJi-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_lnNlJi-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 18:56:21","updateDate":"2013-05-10 19:13:03","locations":[{"id":"oN5ry0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"570 Main Street","locality":"Bangor","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04401","phone":"207-945-3730","website":"http://www.geaghanspub.com","latitude":44.786998,"longitude":-68.777343,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 19:02:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"gGi3oI","name":"Geneva Lake Brewing Company","description":"Local micro brewery in Lake Geneva Wi.\r\n\r\nFounded by father-son duo, Pat and Jon McIntosh, Geneva Lake Brewing Company are proud to be on tap at many locations!

Gaining positive feedback through local beer festivals and finding many comrades in the local brewing community, Zac and Cari sought to open a microbrewery, giving Zac a better excuse to indulge in his obsession.\r\n\r\nEstablished in 2011, Gnarly Barley Brewing is located in a 10,500 square foot facility in Hammond, Louisiana and consists of a two-vessel 30bbl Brewhouse, one hot and one cold liquor tank, four fermentation vessels, one bright beer tank and a whole lot of passion for craft beer.","website":"http://gnarlybeer.com/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vIikZV/upload_FgB4gF-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vIikZV/upload_FgB4gF-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vIikZV/upload_FgB4gF-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-28 18:13:38","updateDate":"2014-10-29 14:39:44","locations":[{"id":"zNaGRX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1709 Corbin Road","locality":"Hammond","region":"LA","postalCode":"70403","phone":"985-318-0723","latitude":30.4972751,"longitude":-90.4785871,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 14:33:42","updateDate":"2014-10-29 14:33:42","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"6RZC0v","name":"Golden Road Brewing","description":"Golden Road is a brewery located in Los Angeles, California.

Let’s start a craft beer brewery!”  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.  \r\n\r\nWith that leap of faith – and a ton of support from many friends and family – they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer – AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite “go to” beer.  \r\n\r\nBy October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving… in Jon’s car.  Lucid was on its way!\r\n\r\nAlways keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover’s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers’ demands.   AIR, DYNO, FOTO and DUO, along with seasonal and small-batch brews, are quickly becoming Minnesota favorites at local bars and restaurants.  \r\n\r\nGreat success has followed them after throwing away the daily grind for the daily brew.","website":"http://www.lucidbrewing.com/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"www.LucidBrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0cACKo/upload_s5bHsF-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0cACKo/upload_s5bHsF-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0cACKo/upload_s5bHsF-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-09-16 13:23:25","locations":[{"id":"1xeovq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6020 Culligan Way","locality":"Minnetonka","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55345","phone":"612-810-9324","website":"http://lucidbrewing.wordpress.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu - Fri: 5:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","latitude":44.895218,"longitude":-93.449725,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"84iCMX","name":"Lucky Town Brewing Company","description":"Living in Mississippi, the selection of beer has always been limited compared to the rest of the country – but that does not stop those of us who seek out the diverse supply of the world’s greatest beers. Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. But for those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.\r\n\r\nDriven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.\r\n\r\nLucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion – to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer. With that mission, Lucas Simmons decided to grant those wishes by sharing his passion for crafting beer in 2011.","website":"http://www.luckytownbrewing.com/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/84iCMX/upload_NKhh2n-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/84iCMX/upload_NKhh2n-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/84iCMX/upload_NKhh2n-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:51:48","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:20","locations":[{"id":"qUIYuC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1710 N Mill St","locality":"Jackson","region":"Mississippi","postalCode":"39202","phone":"(601) 201-0988","website":"http://www.luckytownbrewing.com","latitude":32.319632,"longitude":-90.188048,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:52:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"zkjGKM","name":"Lumina Brewing Company","description":"Lumina Brewing Company is dedicated to producing beer in small batches.

So, it’s a tribute, it’s recognition that there is just as much art to brewing as there is science, and it’s a gentle reminder that to move forward and create a truly excellent future, sometimes you have to look at the past.","website":"http://www.mysterybrewing.com/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http://eepurl.com/goT5b","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/L29NU9/upload_vN4pal-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/L29NU9/upload_vN4pal-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/L29NU9/upload_vN4pal-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2013-08-09 12:53:53","locations":[{"id":"xoGGQz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"437 Dimmocks Mill Road","extendedAddress":"Suite 41","locality":"Hillsborough","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27278","phone":"919-697-8379","website":"http://www.mysterybrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Tap Room:  Friday 6pm - 11pm\r\nOtherwise, By Appointment Only","latitude":36.070686,"longitude":-79.114137,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"KD65Yd","name":"Public House","streetAddress":"230 South Nash Street","locality":"Hillsborough","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27278","phone":"(919) 245-1325","website":"http://www.mysterybrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"M 4 - 10PM\r\nT - Th 4PM - 12AM\r\nF 2PM - 12AM\r\nSat 12PM - 12AM\r\nSun 12PM - 10PM","latitude":36.0736632,"longitude":-79.1110699,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-09 12:44:26","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"7yzKhF","name":"Mystic Brewery","description":"Mystic microbes abhorred the isolation of the industrial age.

These guys (we’ll call them Chris and Josh for lack of anonymity’s sake) got better at brewing over the years, even as they moved apart.\r\n\r\nChris went down a corporate marketing path; Josh seemed to prefer engineering and operations; both still enjoyed beer and, with lots of practice, the homebrew got better and better. When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys’ improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn’t go away.

Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a “Contract Brewing” or “Beer Marketing” company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words \"Skull Coast\" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.","website":"http://skullcoastales.com/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2012-04-20 19:10:08","locations":[{"id":"kXV5lc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"802 Somerton Drive","locality":"Fort Mill","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29715","phone":"803-619-9295","latitude":35.011366,"longitude":-80.956275,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"TjzLgu","name":"Hickory Location","streetAddress":"883 Highland Ave SE","locality":"Hickory","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28602","latitude":35.735156,"longitude":-81.325672,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-20 18:52:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"0YoykS","name":"Slanted Rock Brewing Company","description":"Slanted Rock Brewing Company, LLC was founded in Meridian, Idaho on June 2011 by Bob Lonseth and Vincent Melchor.

The Somerville Brewing Company contracts with regional breweries to make the best recipes for wide-spread commercial release, but each recipe is an evolving process of refinement. This model for beer production provides an opportunity to experiment with innovative local ingredients to produce craft beers that stand apart from typical formulations.","website":"http://www.slumbrew.com/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gwDTjS/upload_BJqSCO-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gwDTjS/upload_BJqSCO-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gwDTjS/upload_BJqSCO-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-13 00:30:15","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:20","locations":[{"id":"pATY6L","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Somerville","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02144","phone":"1-800-428-1150","website":"http://www.slumbrew.com/","latitude":42.402309,"longitude":-71.120132,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-13 00:36:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"CnPWMY","name":"Southbound Brewing Company","description":"Southbound Brewing Company is the first production microbrewery located in Savannah, Georgia.
