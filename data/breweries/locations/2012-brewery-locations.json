My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife’s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.\r\n\r\n- Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing","website":"http://www.3sheepsbrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_c8CRE6-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_c8CRE6-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_c8CRE6-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:04:30","updateDate":"2014-11-12 21:40:12","locations":[{"id":"5R4Akp","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1327 Huron Ave","locality":"Sheboygan","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53081","phone":"920-395-3583","website":"http://www.3sheepsbrewing.com/","latitude":43.7596465,"longitude":-87.7217729,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:05:17","updateDate":"2014-11-12 21:40:13","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"N101SS","name":"38 State Brewing Company","description":"We started out years ago brewing in our garage.

We think we’ve met that goal, & hope you’ll agree.\r\n\r\nAt Aftershock, we believe there are two different approaches to brewing.  The most common approach used by the major breweries is a ‘scientific one’.  All stages of the brewing process are closely monitored to ensure a consistent, if tasteless product.  Computers and other high tech equipment are more in control than the brewer himself.  With this approach you get ‘scientific’ beer.  The other approach is a more artistic one, while still respecting basic laws of science, and the need for spotless cleanliness.  That’s the approach we plan to always take at Aftershock.  At the risk of losing an undetectable amount of consistency, the result is beer with much more character, subtle nuances, and awesome flavor.

After a few years, it was clear they needed to spread the kebab love elsewhere, and decided on a run down old resturant site with an ocean view..\r\n\r\nCraft beer has been a part of the concept since day 1, and JC's severe homebrewing addiction ignited the need for their own brewing system at the new establishment - Amplified Ale Works was born. Why Amplified you ask? Two parts – one, our obsession with live music (a band was formed between CK staff in 2009, playing in JC’s garage ever since), and two, our take on the meaning of Amplified- to us, it means intensifying the craft beer experience by staying true to our homebrewing roots.

Back East brews several different styles of high-quality ales and lagers and distributed on draft and in 64 oz growlers and 750 ml bottles at fine establishments throughout the Greater Hartford area. \r\n\r\nAlthough originally from Connecticut, Edward began to home-brew while living in San Diego in the early 1990s. He eventually moved Back East to Connecticut in 2000, with the dream of someday operating a Craft brewery. As a Professional Engineer, Edward enjoys the technical aspects of brewing. Tony developed his appreciation for Craft beer during his college years in Vermont, and always imagined launching a brewery. An entrepreneur at heart and a CPA with extensive experience in accounting, auditing, and insurance, Tony loves building a successful business from the ground up. Tony and Edward began homebrewing and experimenting with different recipes in early 2006, and immersed themselves in all things Craft beer. \r\n\r\nOver this time, we have developed several exciting recipes that we are proud to put the Back East name on. Our beer will be brewed at our small, but state-of-the-art brewery in Bloomfield.","website":"http://www.backeastbeer.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/NkKRig/upload_U6M846-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/NkKRig/upload_U6M846-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/NkKRig/upload_U6M846-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2012-07-24 22:39:57","locations":[{"id":"8qu3SP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1296A Blue Hills Avenue","locality":"Bloomfield","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06002","phone":"860-214-0088","website":"http://www.backeastbeer.com/","latitude":41.854925,"longitude":-72.70529,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"rhuvI3","name":"Backpocket Brewing","description":"Backpocket Beer is German-inspired and hand-crafted right here in Iowa.

The concept was simple: make a variety of beers that WE wanted to drink and create a tasting opportunity for our customers to come into the brewery to decide what they liked, and buy to go.\r\n\r\nDuring our first year of operation we released over 20 different beers, underwent one expansion, and our MO remains the same as it was in the beginning. In addition to the retail store our beers can also be found in over 30 local bars and restaurants.\r\n\r\nYou can be sure when you pick up a glass or bottle of our beer that you’re drinking a fresh local product. We work that little old brew house like a pack mule to crank out as much beer as possible. Nearly all of our beer is sold to customers within a week of leaving our brite tanks.

Our water is double filtered and boiled to give us a “clean slate”, and to finish it off we adjust the natural flavor compounds in the water to suit our various beer styles.\r\n\r\nGood ingredients are the start of a great brew…\r\n\r\nWe use time honored and perfected brewing traditions that have been passed down from brewmaster to brewmaster for centuries. These methods are steeped in artisan spirit and have the precision of science. Using these methods, with our state of the art brewing system allows us to produce hand crafted beers that are pure, free of added chemicals and preservatives, full of flavor and rich in character. \r\nGenerations of brewers have combined their knowledge to bring you this pint\r\nPassion for the craft of beer is in every batch we make. Our brewmaster makes beer because he loves beer. The satisfaction of a job well done is confirmed with the good times, new friendships and community that is formed around sharing a great pint.\r\n\r\nFor the Love of Beer","website":"http://BigRigBrew.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Kx8Y6c/upload_twKZNU-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Kx8Y6c/upload_twKZNU-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Kx8Y6c/upload_twKZNU-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 14:55:12","updateDate":"2014-03-16 14:55:58","locations":[{"id":"BiNSTd","name":"Brewpub","streetAddress":"2750A Iris Street","locality":"Ottawa","region":"Ontario","postalCode":"K2C 1E6","phone":"+1 613-688-3336","website":"http://BigRigBrew.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Wed: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nThu: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nFri: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSat - Sun: 9:00 am - 1:00 am","latitude":45.3482436,"longitude":-75.7861015,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 14:55:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"HxJ67V","name":"Big Rip Brewing Company","description":"The Big Rip was founded by two friends who caught the beer and wine making bug years ago and decided to throw in together to start this brewery.

While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds – beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers. \r\n\r\nWhat’s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.\r\n\r\nWhile German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.  No matter your mood or what you are craving, we have the right beer for you.","website":"http://www.brevard-brewing.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/enoxkn/upload_H1vHPy-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/enoxkn/upload_H1vHPy-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/enoxkn/upload_H1vHPy-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:03:43","updateDate":"2012-04-30 12:45:09","locations":[{"id":"ktgW91","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"63 East Main Street","locality":"Brevard","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28712","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  2:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  2:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\nMonday-Thursday:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 2:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSunday: 2:00pm - 9:00pm","latitude":35.2333243,"longitude":-82.7333116,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:04:50","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:32","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"U4VAH8","name":"Brew Crew Inc","description":"This fall 2013 the tasting room & brewing production facility will open for our beers.\r\n\r\nThe Brew Crew is a group of former home brewers.","website":"http://brewcrew.co","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/U4VAH8/upload_igkVZP-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/U4VAH8/upload_igkVZP-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/U4VAH8/upload_igkVZP-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 16:42:33","updateDate":"2013-11-01 16:43:28","locations":[{"id":"OHxbQf","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"11626 Sterling Ave","extendedAddress":"Suite G","locality":"Riverside","region":"California","postalCode":"92503","phone":"(951) 286-2739","website":"http://brewcrew.co","latitude":33.895437,"longitude":-117.484886,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 16:43:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"8iY0UW","name":"Brewery Ferment","description":"Ferment is an inviting, casual, neighborhood brewery that is truly all about the beer.

We are located by the Southwest corner of 44th Ave. and Wadsworth Blvd.\r\n\r\nOur take on beer is simple – Use great ingredients and brew for flavor!  Rickoli’s respects the liquid in the glass and wants to help elevate beer to a refined drinking experience. That’s why we use the finest ingredients and brew in a leisurely manner. The beer tells us when it’s ready. We refuse to be a slave to production deadlines.  Wheat Ridge Colorado is a relaxed community just west of Denver with easy access from I-70. Wheat Ridge was one of the few remaining enclaves along the Front Range without a microbrewery. This changed in November 2012!  We are dedicated to providing our local neighborhood with a place to relax and have a pint close to home.\r\n\r\nOur Brew master, Rick Abitbol has been professionally brewing award winning beers along the Front Range for over a decade.  Rick is respectful of beer styles and traditional brewing technique.  And has long been an innovator of style and not afraid to color outside the lines. He was one of the first brewers to explore the Black IPA which has since come to be regarded as a new style in judging guidelines.   We love hops! That’s not to say you won’t find any wonderfully malty creations on tap there are many, but what you will notice is the variety in our hoppy selections.  Be on the lookout for Rick’s special brews!\r\n\r\nWe’re Talking Much Better Beer!  We are pleased to feature a great selection of Gluten Reduced Beer.  All Rickoli’s brews that do not contain wheat are considered gluten reduced.  Making great craft beer more accessible to everyone.\r\n  \r\nOur glass rinsing stations insure a beer clean glass every time! We want you to drink beer not sanitizer! We hope you will stop by for a pint or two!","website":"http://www.breweryrickoli.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0MtSfA/upload_ulX1Zv-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0MtSfA/upload_ulX1Zv-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0MtSfA/upload_ulX1Zv-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-17 01:45:41","updateDate":"2013-08-09 12:16:03","locations":[{"id":"NrF8QR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4335 Wadsworth","locality":"Wheat Ridge","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80033","phone":"(303) 344-8988","website":"http://www.breweryrickoli.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\nTue:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\nWed:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\nThu:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\n\nMon: 3:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nTue - Thu: 3:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm","latitude":39.7756487,"longitude":-105.0815258,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-17 11:37:18","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"O7hh8Y","name":"Brickside Brewery","description":"Copper Harbor's first and only microbrewery, and the first in Keweenaw county in over a hundred years.

Culture’s three owners, John Niedernhofer (Owner), Steve Ragan (Owner/Brew Master) and Dennis Williams (Owner) began brewing together long ago. From their earliest brainstorms about taking things to the next level, the goal was always to create more than just great beer. Bringing their approachable style to the already rich community of the craft beer industry, they opened their brewery in February 2013.\r\n\r\nOur modern and rustic microbrewery is the ideal showcase for our beer. The brewery is our tasting room, with everything you need and nothing you don’t. The tasting room features an inviting beer service counter, ample indoor and outdoor space for visitors with an ocean breeze. The tasting room’s 12-tap serving system (including Nitro) allows us to deliver a large variety of our crafted beers. The on-site Brewhouse is equipped with a 10 barrel Premier Stainless System including a boil kettle, mash tun, 5 fermenters and 3 brite/serving tanks.

Whether you've brewed before or you have no idea what you're doing, we're here to guide you through every step of the process and make it as easy and as fun as possible. \r\n\r\nEudora will also serve as a taproom, where we'll brew our own ales and lagers and serve them on draft. The pub will be open to brew-on-premise customers as well as the general public. We offer a variety of award-winning house-brewed beers as well as non-alcoholic beverages and a small selection of snacks.\r\n\r\nEudora will also donate a portion of EVERY sale toward funding a water project for those in need of clean water. We're teaming up with a group called Charity: Water whose mission is to end the water crisis happening all over the world. With each purchase you make at Eudora, you're helping Charity: Water build wells and water purification systems in villages, schools and clinics in areas where water is difficult to obtain. We use a TON of water in the brewing process. It's the least we can do to give back and do our part to fight the water crisis. With your help, we can change lives and help make the world a better place!","website":"http://www.EudoraBrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KWQ56O/upload_KTJ8jR-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KWQ56O/upload_KTJ8jR-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KWQ56O/upload_KTJ8jR-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-22 17:34:08","updateDate":"2013-11-22 17:35:02","locations":[{"id":"YxwBJy","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"4716 Wilmington Pike","locality":"Kettering","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45440","phone":"(937) 723-6863","website":"http://www.EudoraBrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu - Fri: 3:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":39.67479,"longitude":-84.115728,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-22 17:34:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"b80J5o","name":"Excel Brewing Company","description":"Excel Brewing Company runs a 20 BBL brewhouse.

Our long term goal is a bottling factory and additional restaurants that will employee hundreds of local workers.\r\n\r\nKeeping with our philosophy of locally sourced goods and services, we will purchase from local companies whenever possible. On the food side this includes local fish markets, meat markets and bakeries; and on the brewery side designing beers that will be made using Michigan grown hops and malt. And it doesn’t stop there! We are actively negotiating and designing the brew house, promotional materials, general construction and website operations with Michigan companies.\r\n\r\nWhere it is not possible to source a product or service locally or in the State of Michigan, we will be looking first to keep our business in the Mid-West and then United States.

We feel this benefits everyone in this endeavor where we support the community that is supporting us. A Win-Win for everyone!\r\n\r\nIt’s All About the Beer!\r\n\r\nWe are going to be creating quality; handcrafted beers that we believe will be some of the best beer you have ever tried.

We've been making beer for many years now and wanted to share our love of beer with as many people as we could. With that in mind, we founded Great Storm Brewing in 2010, and opened our doors and our taps to the public in March 2012.\r\n\r\nOur name? Well, for us, there's a lot of anticipation in tasting a new beer. The way the foam settles in a glass of dark stout, or the raining effect you can see in a pint of IPA served on nitro... they remind us sometimes of the expectant feeling we get watching powerful storms roll in over the mountains in our home town of Colorado Springs. Yes, we tend to wax poetic over a pint glass. I told you we love beer. But anyway, that was part of the inspiration. The other part was our beloved half Husky, half Aussie brewdog, Storm. He's a little... wild. Like our beers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope you'll find the same passion for drinking our beers as we do for making them.

A 13 foot garage door opens to an L-Shaped outdoor patio with cushioned keg barrel seating and planters with local varietal hop bines (hop vines) that can grow up to 25+ feet along horizontal trellises.","website":"http://hillcrestbrewingcompany.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n0PQKV/upload_e8tqTb-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n0PQKV/upload_e8tqTb-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n0PQKV/upload_e8tqTb-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-22 12:25:36","updateDate":"2014-03-16 21:16:07","locations":[{"id":"2GV1it","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1458 University Avenue","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92103","phone":"619-269-4323","website":"http://hillcrestbrewingcompany.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Fri:\t4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat - Sun:\t12:00 pm - 12:00 am","latitude":32.748559,"longitude":-117.15023,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-22 12:26:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"SvPqW6","name":"Hob Knob Brewing Company","website":"http://hobknobbrewery.blogspot.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/SvPqW6/upload_xVSh4d-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/SvPqW6/upload_xVSh4d-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/SvPqW6/upload_xVSh4d-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-06-15 20:37:11","updateDate":"2012-08-12 11:15:04","locations":[{"id":"cHZPbY","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Cornelius","region":"North Carolina","latitude":35.48158,"longitude":-80.859022,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-06-15 20:38:21","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"3hiVzD","name":"Holly Springs Nano Brewing","description":"A funky little brewery in planning, in an old bank bldg, deep in the heart of the urban jungle of downtown in Holly Springs.","website":"http://hollyspringsnanobrewing.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3hiVzD/upload_yQDyjN-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3hiVzD/upload_yQDyjN-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3hiVzD/upload_yQDyjN-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-04-19 23:36:09","updateDate":"2014-02-20 16:33:11","locations":[{"id":"96P2f6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"100 N.

I had always liked my beer, but I realized that there tends to be a brewer’s bias towards their own beer.  A great deal of time and effort goes into making a batch of beer, so the brewer is bound to speak highly of their own goods.  It turns out, I’m my own worst critic.  I’m constantly searching for ways to improve the beer.  Whenever I shared brews with others, they always liked it as well, but who doesn’t like free beer?  For me, the seed was planted quite a few years ago when I started winning homebrewing awards statewide.  It was then I began to realize that I was making more than just pretty good homebrew.  I was making some damn good beer!  I began volunteering to judge at homebrew competitions and making an effort to get out and sample more of the beers not available in northern Minnesota.  I quickly realized that there was much more to explore in the world of beer than I realized.  I studied and tasted everything I could find regarding brewing science and beer styles.  In the midst of all of the studying and research, I took the Beer Judge Certification Program test and obtained a National rank in the BJCP.  I now had some credentials to back up my knowledge of good beer and brewing.  It was clear that this was starting to become more than just a hobby, so I began to put a bit more time and effort into the dream of starting a brewery.\r\n\r\nSo, after all this research and planning, what’s the plan?  Start small.\r\n\r\nJack Pine Brewery is starting very small.  Nanobrewery small.  Brewing forty gallons at a time small.  Did I mention the brewer is small?\r\n\r\nThis little brewery serves as a pilot system for the eventual build-out of a full scale production brewery.  It provides the opportunity to test the waters before sinking a boatload of cash into a warehouse full of stainless equipment.  Best of all, it gives YOU a chance to TRY THE BEER!  I’ve been my own worst critic for the past 12 years of homebrewing.  Now it’s your turn.  With your help, we can build a brewery to provide our friends and neighbors with delicious locally-brewed beer.\r\n\r\nSo, stop in and give it a try!","website":"http://jackpinebrewery.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_6VMNdS-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_6VMNdS-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_6VMNdS-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-16 22:52:53","updateDate":"2014-01-17 14:27:43","locations":[{"id":"CPYUBy","name":"Jack Pine Brewery - Taproom","streetAddress":"7942 College Rd, Ste 115","locality":"Brainerd","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"56425","phone":"(218) 270-8072","website":"http://jackpinebrewery.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday 4-7pm\r\nSaturday 4-7pm","latitude":46.3447626,"longitude":-94.2338287,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-16 22:54:29","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"4x0UAF","name":"JAFB-Wooster Brewery","website":"http://www.jafbbeer.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4x0UAF/upload_EOEv6h-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4x0UAF/upload_EOEv6h-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4x0UAF/upload_EOEv6h-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 17:31:14","updateDate":"2013-08-06 20:29:30","locations":[{"id":"aAMifM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"120 Beall Avenue","locality":"Wooster","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44691","phone":"(330) 601-1827","website":"http://www.jafbbeer.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Tuesday-Thursday 4pm-9pm,\r\nFriday 3pm-12am\r\nSaturday 1pm-12am, \r\nClosed Sunday and Monday.","latitude":40.7992702,"longitude":-81.9344413,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-06 20:28:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"ekxWv9","name":"James River Brewing Company","description":"The James River Brewing Company grew organically from a simple weekend experiment.

A careful blend is used to create the distinctive aroma and taste profiles of each recipe.","website":"http://www.leamsidebrewery.co.uk/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 17:31:54","updateDate":"2013-08-06 20:32:48","locations":[{"id":"onoKyE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Pithouse Lane","locality":"Leamside","region":"Tyne and Wear","postalCode":"DH4 6QQ","phone":"(0191) 584 2394","website":"http://www.leamsidebrewery.co.uk/","latitude":54.8239825,"longitude":-1.5190383,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-06 20:33:43","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"QXkarn","name":"Legacy Brewing Company","website":"http://www.legacybrewingco.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QXkarn/upload_38Zrp8-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QXkarn/upload_38Zrp8-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QXkarn/upload_38Zrp8-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:36:58","updateDate":"2014-03-16 21:37:58","locations":[{"id":"HIzVEo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"363 Airport Road","locality":"Oceanside","region":"California","postalCode":"92058","phone":"(760) 705-3221","website":"http://www.legacybrewingco.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":33.2153901,"longitude":-117.3507698,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:37:30","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"oBALsi","name":"Little Egypt Beer","description":"A tiny start up brewery in Southern Illinois (Egypt) specializing in recognizable stylistic beers.","website":"http://www.littleegyptbeer.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBALsi/upload_ualj3d-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBALsi/upload_ualj3d-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBALsi/upload_ualj3d-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 17:05:18","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:15:53","locations":[{"id":"3RFxH6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"140 Buttermilk Hill Rd.","locality":"Ava","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"62907","phone":"(618) 521-3815","website":"http://www.littleegyptbeer.com/","latitude":37.7733175,"longitude":-89.4818853,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-06 20:37:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"pQw6oS","name":"Lone Pint Brewery","description":"Scrumptious Texas Hoppy Ales","website":"http://www.lonepint.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pQw6oS/upload_wIwMwq-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pQw6oS/upload_wIwMwq-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pQw6oS/upload_wIwMwq-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-25 18:48:21","locations":[{"id":"LN8yp5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"507 Commerce St","locality":"Magnolia","region":"Texas","postalCode":"77355","phone":"713-304-5069","website":"http://www.lonepint.com/","latitude":30.208685,"longitude":-95.751524,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"wCJ57q","name":"Lookout Brewing Company","description":"Freshly brewed beer.

Our specialty is handcrafted gourmet brick oven pizzas complimented with great apps, salads, and sandwiches, all washed down with quality craft brews. We have a full bar, free Wi-Fi, and several HDTV's for all your sports viewing pleasure.\r\n \r\nAt Mountain Madness we can best be described as passionate. We're passionate about people (and dogs), we're passionate about great craft beer and gourmet pizza, and we're insanely passionate about the mountains. Mountain Madness is the culmination of a life long dream of its founder to create an experience that combines these passions.\r\n \r\nWe will continue to remodel, tweak, and enhance Mountain Madness as we strive to perfect your neighborhood pub. We are simple, casual, and unique by design...and we love dogs!

We then, in turn, purchase this well-fed livestock and nutrient-rich vegetables to make our steaks, burgers, salads, side dishes and so many other items on our menu.\r\n\r\nOur goal is not only to bring you the freshest, most flavorful food and beer possible, but also to aim as high as we can for true sustainability.","website":"http://www.nevinsbrewing.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vM3y9r/upload_hOYDPS-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vM3y9r/upload_hOYDPS-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vM3y9r/upload_hOYDPS-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:25:50","updateDate":"2013-08-13 14:49:41","locations":[{"id":"OR1ggJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"12337 South Rt. 59","locality":"Plainfield","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60585","phone":"(815) 436-3900","website":"http://www.nevinsbrewing.com/","latitude":41.656777,"longitude":-88.202701,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:26:36","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"mq9W2O","name":"New Buffalo Brewing Company","description":"Buffalo, New York welcomed in the 20th century with the Pan American Exposition.  It was a time of amazing progress.  Electricity was cutting-edge technology, and the possibilities seemed endless.  Hard times lay ahead for the country and for Buffalo though; The Great War would rage and The Great Depression would last for nearly a decade before the United States would emerge from the second World War as the leader of the Free World.\r\n\r\nWhat does any of that have to do with a startup craft-brewery?  The New Buffalo Brewing Co. shares the same passion for progress.  Buffalo produced over half a million barrels of brew in 1896, but by the end of the 1970's, production halted to almost zero. The United States is emerging from that low point as the world leader in brewing. Home brewing is continually growing, and new nano-breweries are popping up everywhere. Once again, The United States is leading the way by taking brewing forward into the next golden age.\r\n\r\nSo raise your glass in a toast to progress; It’s time to bring brewing back to Buffalo!","website":"http://www.newbuffalobrewing.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/mq9W2O/upload_RWbQWP-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/mq9W2O/upload_RWbQWP-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/mq9W2O/upload_RWbQWP-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-21 18:02:29","updateDate":"2012-04-21 22:07:33","locations":[{"id":"x0saIe","name":"Office","streetAddress":"P.O.

We have a tasting room up front where you can come in, try tasters & pints, and buy growlers (re-fillable jugs of beer).","website":"http://www.oakhillsbrewing.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bnVj0y/upload_PS68oC-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bnVj0y/upload_PS68oC-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bnVj0y/upload_PS68oC-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-07 06:06:44","updateDate":"2013-11-08 22:34:14","locations":[{"id":"thFM14","name":"Oak Hills Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"12221 Poplar St #3","locality":"Hesperia","region":"California","postalCode":"92344","phone":"(760) 244-8278","website":"http://www.oakhillsbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Tap Room Hours:\r\nThursday    3pm-9pm\r\nFriday       12pm-9pm\r\nSaturday   12pm-9pm","latitude":34.4149387,"longitude":-117.3958456,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-07 06:13:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"gicLqz","name":"Off the Grid Brewing Company","description":"\"IT'S NOT JUST A BEER, IT'S A STATE OF MIND.\"","website":"http://otgbrew.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gicLqz/upload_IQPhLj-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gicLqz/upload_IQPhLj-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gicLqz/upload_IQPhLj-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:21:48","updateDate":"2013-01-05 15:22:45","locations":[{"id":"9na4NR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1710 Palmyrita Ave.","extendedAddress":"Suite #11","locality":"Riverside","region":"California","postalCode":"92507","website":"http://otgbrew.com/","latitude":34.003894,"longitude":-117.3487347,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:22:20","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"todpTX","name":"Offbeat Brewing Company","description":"Offbeat Brewing Company is a small collective of like-minded people who believe that well-crafted beer, untethered art, and the communities that support them are what make life worth living.

For us, brewing beer began as an excuse to gather with our friends and ruminate on life, philosophy, music, food, and of course, beer. Once we got started, we grew more curious about the brewing process, honing our craft and experimenting with different methods and techniques. Along the way a fundamental question to our process was, how can we do more of this ourselves? Our desire to participate in every step of the grain to glass process led us to open Our Mutual Friend.\r\n\r\nAt OMF, our goal is to use local sources to brew local ales. This is why we malt and roast as much of the grain we use in our beer as we can. As a small maltstery, we have more influence over the quality and freshness of the beers we pour in our taproom, and more opportunities to source our ingredients locally. 100 percent of our barley is grown right here in Colorado. And as much as possible, we source our hops and specialty ingredients from farms in our state. \r\n\r\nPart of what we love about beer is its power to bring people together (hence our name!). We’re excited to be a gathering place in the Five Points neighborhood where locals and visitors alike can meet in camaraderie alongside a quality pint of ale.

Our brewery is a 1 barrel system (two kegs) which we use to create hand-crafted, more often than not, specialty ales.  Our brewery is based around experimentation, so our taps change frequently.  We usually do not brew the same beer twice, but will do so if enough people ask.\r\n\r\nBy definition, an outlander is a stranger, a foreigner, but here he is much more. This is how we see him: The outlander is the innovator; he is the one who drives change. It is the outlander, whether in mind or origin, who represents the ambitious, passionate pioneer who is willing to put everything on the line in order to make his dream come true. It’s often a simple dream, a dream to share his knowledge, his expertise with the ones who call him stranger. And certainly the public may reject his ideas, they may cast him back to where he came from. But does this ever worry the outlander? Never. Because the outlander believes in his ideas. He knows what he is offering is great and he knows others, once they put aside their prejudice, will know this too. He knows that someone who has invested their time, their life, their hopes and dreams behind something cannot fail. And he knows one last vital piece of information– that there have been many outlanders in this world before him and there will be many more to come.","website":"http://www.outlanderbrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4iDXFJ/upload_pLt4tJ-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4iDXFJ/upload_pLt4tJ-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4iDXFJ/upload_pLt4tJ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-18 19:20:59","updateDate":"2013-02-19 11:29:22","locations":[{"id":"A6u3vC","name":"Brewery & Pub","streetAddress":"225 N.36th St.","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98103","phone":"(206) 486-4088","website":"http://outlanderbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday – Closed\r\nTuesday – 4pm – 10pm\r\nWednesday – 4pm – 10pm\r\nThursday – 4pm – 12am\r\nFriday – 4pm – 1am\r\nSaturday – 2pm – 1am\r\nSunday – 2pm– 10pm","latitude":47.652227,"longitude":-122.3555637,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-18 19:22:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"AD6iLC","name":"Oval Brewing Company","description":"Oval Brewing is a start-up commercial brewery and tap-room, once open it will operate as a “social brewery” in Columbus, Ohio.

Dan started brewing around 1990, using extracts. He took up the hobby in earnest which meant taking over the garage 5 years ago and transitioning to all-grain brewing. Both Dan and Elle love to cook and brewing days became a natural outlet for hosting all days BBQs with family and friends. The 5-gallon kettle over the kitchen stove grew to a half-barrel, propane-fueled brew rig. And the backyard gained a pellet-smoker alongside the Weber grill. That’s what we call going the distance with brewing and charcuterie!\r\n\r\nWith family and friends raving about our creation, it’s time to take it seriously. We entered the 2011 California State Fair and won three medals including first place for our Knock-Out Stout and second place for The Contender – our Pale Ale. The following year we won first place for our Scottish Ale which we plan on featuring as one of our seasonal brews.\r\n\r\nIn early 2012 we decided to pursue opening our own microbrewery. Our first challenge seemed almost insurmountable: finding a name! We hit trademark snags with our first three names and finally scored with Twelve Rounds.","website":"http://www.twelveroundsbrewing.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hLGKwV/upload_n6jGiw-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hLGKwV/upload_n6jGiw-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hLGKwV/upload_n6jGiw-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-29 17:19:57","updateDate":"2013-03-29 17:19:58","locations":[{"id":"AQE3Sx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"866 57th St.","locality":"Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95819","phone":"(916) 500-1059","website":"http://www.twelveroundsbrewing.com/","latitude":38.566033,"longitude":-121.433545,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-29 17:20:33","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"sxCtT5","name":"Two-Shy Brewing","description":"Two-Shy Brewing crafts fine ales and lagers like Phat Odd Stout, Influence IPA, Dead-On Amber, Reformation Red, Picnic Pale, Ignition Double IPA, Everlasting ESB, Toby's Best, Uberdunkelweizen and more!","website":"http://www.twoshybrewing.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/sxCtT5/upload_c0MKzW-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/sxCtT5/upload_c0MKzW-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/sxCtT5/upload_c0MKzW-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-01 02:14:51","updateDate":"2013-08-01 12:13:32","locations":[{"id":"e7pl4v","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1308 NW Park St","locality":"Roseburg","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97470","phone":"(541) 236-2055","website":"http://www.twoshybrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat: 12:00 pm - 4:00 pm","latitude":43.224355,"longitude":-123.354907,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-01 12:12:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"PpNk6z","name":"Überbrew","description":"Überbrew: Superlative Beer\r\n\r\nCombining atmosphere, music, food, service and award winning beer to provide the customer with the best tap room experience.","website":"http://www.uberbrewmt.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PpNk6z/upload_3sWdVr-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PpNk6z/upload_3sWdVr-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PpNk6z/upload_3sWdVr-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-28 15:04:10","updateDate":"2014-09-10 14:45:55","locations":[{"id":"K2qBGW","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2305 Montana Ave","locality":"Billings","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59101","phone":"(406) 534-6960","website":"http://www.uberbrewmt.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":45.7842344,"longitude":-108.4993717,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-28 15:04:57","updateDate":"2014-09-20 15:00:58","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"WmgEVf","name":"Union Brewing Company","description":"At Union Brewing Company, our artisan ales are hand crafted two barrels at a time using time honored traditions, natural ingredients and traditional methods.

From that conversation forward there would be no looking back. A business plan was developed and hundreds of test batches brewed. In 2011 Walt and Luke’s lifelong friend Ryan Guthy and his parents Rick and Denise all sat down at their house in the mountains of Western North Carolina to taste some of Luke and Walt’s creations while looking over the plans for what would be Wicked Weed Brewing.  After being thoroughly impressed with the full flavor and vision of the project, the Guthys joined the Dickinsons and the team was assembled.  Over the next months Wicked Weed Brewing found a home at 91 Biltmore avenue, a building that seemed destined to be a brewery.\r\nWith the creativity of Luke, vision of Walt, dedication of Ryan, exquisite taste of Denise and wisdom of Rick a truly unique brewery was born.  So from the humble beginning of a basement, the dream of Wicked Weed Brewing has come to life. Our beer is bold, full of excitement and flavor.  Always focused on drinkability and pushing the boundaries of what we think we are capable of.  Wicked Weed Brewing will always evolve, always grow and always aspire to be greater.  Join us in bringing something a little Wicked to Asheville.","website":"http://wickedweedbrewing.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zeWbuM/upload_rxRe0d-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zeWbuM/upload_rxRe0d-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zeWbuM/upload_rxRe0d-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-06-15 13:18:30","updateDate":"2014-06-12 11:31:23","locations":[{"id":"90gAzo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"91 Biltmore Ave","locality":"Asheville","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28801","phone":"828-575-9599","website":"http://wickedweedbrewing.com/","latitude":35.591695,"longitude":-82.551084,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-06-15 13:19:17","updateDate":"2014-09-13 12:33:11","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"7LrYr1","name":"Wiens Brewing Company","description":"Wiens Brewing Company is a new Temecula brewery!

The idea behind the name Wildcard is to pursue the unknown. Wildcard Brewing Company’s owners left stability for chaos, moved to England to learn the craft of beer making, and started a business in an uncertain economy, all in pursuit of a dream. You’d call them crazy, adventurous, unpredictable....a wildcard. Our story is one of the unexpected; a place where there are no limits, where perseverance and a free spirit will turn dreams into reality. \r\n\r\nIt started when Jeff and Jenny brewed two beers to give away as wedding favors at a brewery in San Luis Obispo where they went to college. Homebrew projects and burst bottle explosions ensued in the years after. But a casual passion soon turned career as Jeff and Jenny headed to England. Jeff studied brewing science at the University of Sunderland and Jenny conducted “research” in various local pubs. Once back in the states Jeff headed straight for the most competitive brewing location, the Pacific Northwest. Now 4 years later the pair are back in Jeff’s hometown of Redding building out their production brewery.\r\n\r\nWildcard is small startup business focused on brewing flavorful beers and enriching the communities that enjoy them. Spending dollars locally is just a part of that commitment. We will source products and services within 500 miles of our facility as much as possible and intend to exclusively sell beers within that same area. Supporting local businesses not only has great economic impacts but environmental as well. We don’t want to just do business in the Redding community we want to be a part of it. It is important to give back as much as possible to the community and we will make it a point to donate and get involved in local causes and efforts.","website":"http://www.wildcardbrewingco.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TD4EGg/upload_DQdvya-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TD4EGg/upload_DQdvya-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TD4EGg/upload_DQdvya-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-02 18:23:11","updateDate":"2013-03-02 18:25:15","locations":[{"id":"YbkkwZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9565 Crossroads Dr","locality":"Redding","region":"California","postalCode":"96003","phone":"(530) 722-9239","website":"http://www.wildcardbrewingco.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Thu: 2:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","latitude":40.565865,"longitude":-122.297279,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-02 18:23:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"QS1jCV","name":"Wildwood Brewing","description":"Wildwood Brewery is a organic craft brewery in Western Montana committed to building an integrated brewing/farming system where all wastes are used as value-added input.","website":"http://wildwoodbrewing.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-10 11:53:50","updateDate":"2012-12-10 11:58:13","locations":[{"id":"okwu8a","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4018 US Hwy 93 North","locality":"Stevensville","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59870","phone":"(406) 777-2855","website":"http://wildwoodbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm","latitude":46.53121,"longitude":-114.110864,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-10 11:54:27","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"5QaO07","name":"Windswept Brewing Co","description":"Beautiful beaches, a great climate, superb golf courses, fishing, nearby mountains and the world's best whisky, the Moray Coast is a great place to live.
