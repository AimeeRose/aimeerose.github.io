Let me explain. 350 Augusta Ave. was our address in Dekalb, IL. At the time, your founders Todd and Erik spent more time on projects like way below average punk rock bands in the attic, and a Hardcore Wrestling Federation called WCVF (this took place in our kitchen), instead of focusing on classes like Humanities 227 in DuSable Hall. I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to \"550 degrees\"? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night. This raw energy (stupidity) and creativity is what eventually drew us to the Craft Beer scene. That’s what craft beer is…a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well…..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.\r\n\r\nOnce NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik’s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!! \r\n\r\nFrom that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park’s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to joining the family of incredible Illinois Brewers. We should all thank our lucky stars that we live in a state with such high quality Breweries.","website":"http://350Brewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_pRw6FS-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_pRw6FS-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_pRw6FS-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:35:25","updateDate":"2014-07-25 13:35:25","locations":[{"id":"1mRL8J","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7144 183rd St","locality":"Tinley Park","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60477","website":"http://350Brewing.com","latitude":41.5593734,"longitude":-87.7911748,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:36:01","updateDate":"2014-07-25 13:36:01","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"zZVmWp","name":"3Cross Brewing Company","description":"A small brewery and taproom in Worcester, Massachusetts.","website":"http://3crossbrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zZVmWp/upload_cwh44s-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zZVmWp/upload_cwh44s-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zZVmWp/upload_cwh44s-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-01 20:18:10","updateDate":"2014-11-13 18:15:18","locations":[{"id":"PCFyGl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"26 Cambridge Street","locality":"Worcester","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01603","website":"http://3crossbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.244075,"longitude":-71.8304129,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-01 20:18:11","updateDate":"2014-11-13 18:15:07","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"lzuP4P","name":"51 North Brewing Company","description":"Attention Beer Lovers, what you've been hearing is true!

Because it will be brewed in such small batches, much of the beer will be available only for purchase in the Bike Dog tasting room — allowing customers to see the beer go from grain to glass and hobnob with the brewers and allowing the brewers to personally nurture the local craft beer community.","website":"http://www.bikedogbrewing.com/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iW1GUi/upload_pqYKKU-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iW1GUi/upload_pqYKKU-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iW1GUi/upload_pqYKKU-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-31 20:04:43","updateDate":"2014-01-01 03:31:07","locations":[{"id":"KdoYYr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2534 Industrial Boulevard","extendedAddress":"#110","locality":"West Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95691","phone":"(916) 432-3376","website":"http://www.bikedogbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Fri: 5:00 pm - 9:30 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 9:30 pm","latitude":38.566263,"longitude":-121.543518,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-01 03:30:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"dWNb1s","name":"Bird Brain Brewing Co.","description":"Bird Brain Brewing Co was founded in 2013 with the goal of producing the highest quality and best tasting beer available and bringing it to the masses.","website":"http://www.birdbrainbrewing.com/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dWNb1s/upload_JSP7f2-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dWNb1s/upload_JSP7f2-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dWNb1s/upload_JSP7f2-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-19 16:05:06","updateDate":"2014-11-20 00:45:36","locations":[{"id":"bC3Yxv","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Arlington","region":"Virginia","website":"http://www.birdbrainbrewing.com/","latitude":38.8799697,"longitude":-77.1067698,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-20 00:46:14","updateDate":"2014-11-20 00:46:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"TEG3J9","name":"Bissell Brothers","description":"Self-Distributed American Ale Factory // Portland, Maine","website":"http://www.bissellbrothers.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-25 20:00:23","updateDate":"2014-08-28 12:15:19","locations":[{"id":"rDrEhT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"One Industrial Way","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04101","phone":"(207) 423-3622","website":"http://www.bissellbrothers.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  1:00pm - 6:00pm\nFri:  1:00pm - 6:00pm\nSat:  1:00pm - 6:00pm\n\n","latitude":43.702795,"longitude":-70.319935,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-28 12:14:49","updateDate":"2014-08-28 12:14:49","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"8uxJKW","name":"Black Sky Brewery","description":"Beer.Pizza.Metal.

Through the integration of sustainable production methods, environmentally conscious waste management and innovative water recycling/reclamation techniques, we hope to become a model for breweries and agricultural destinations throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nThe BrewhouseThe brew house is an engineered mix of new and old technologies and techniques. Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.","website":"http://www.breweryterrafirma.com/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:30:28","updateDate":"2013-11-18 12:30:28","locations":[{"id":"1QFuku","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2959 Hartman Rd","locality":"Traverse City","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49685","phone":"(231) 929-1600","website":"http://www.breweryterrafirma.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","latitude":44.7154521,"longitude":-85.6354376,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:32:00","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:47","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"xLOOss","name":"Brick Street Brewing Company","description":"Brick Street Brewing Company is a locally owned and operated 1 BBL microbrewery located just off Highway 30 in the heart of historic Woodbine, Iowa.

With over 15 years of combined professional brewing experience and an uncanny ability to tolerate one another, they decided it was time to take a leap and chase the dream of opening their own brewery.\r\n\r\nWith both Jason and Brian calling Golden, Colorado home, the choice for a location was obvious.  After settling on a property on the north side of town, they wanted the brewery name to reflect the home town they loved.  After doing some research they learned that the original name for the majestic Clear Creek that runs through the center of Golden was Cannonball Creek.  The historical significance paired with the duo’s love for the iconic Cannonball made the decision a no-brainer and Cannonball Creek Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nKnowing that they wouldn’t be able to do it all on their own, Jason and Brian called upon former co-worker and professional brewer Jonathan Lee to help run the tasting room and work in the brewery.  Jonathan’s experience as a craft beer bar manager, combined with his professional brewing experience made him the perfect fit.","website":"http://www.cannonballcreekbrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/UWtF4X/upload_w0oqNL-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/UWtF4X/upload_w0oqNL-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/UWtF4X/upload_w0oqNL-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-23 14:09:04","updateDate":"2014-10-06 19:51:23","locations":[{"id":"CFIZtr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"393 N.

They soon found another shared interest--experiencing the world of beer. The two made many friends spending spare evenings in New England pubs offering European beers, which, before the emergence of American craft beers, were the best beers available. The two often discussed their dream of opening their own brewery over the years. In August of 2012, John and Dan decided to take the keg into their own hands, and ENKI Brewing Company was born. Just a few months later, their dreams came to fruition at 7929 Victoria Drive.

We are brewers and culinarians.\r\n\r\nWe want our beer to taste good, but we also want it to taste good with food. We don’t want to blow-out your palate, we want you to explore the hidden flavors and understand the complexities of the taste.\r\n\r\nWe love beer. We want you to love beer.\r\n\r\nWe will focus on crafting beers between 4.5% and 7.0% ABV. Our goal is a well-balanced, well-crafted, session beer. We’ll do the hop-thing too, but always with an exciting and culinary-focused angle.\r\n\r\nHere’s the other thing. We’re adventurous. San Diego is the brew capital of the world (are we exaggerating here… NO!) There’s lots of great brewers. We found a few of them and held them down, twisted their arm really hard and asked them to brew something new and out there for us. Then, we found a few chefs who thought brewing was good sport. We helped them with the technical stuff and set them loose with the brew equipment.\r\n\r\nYou’ll see their brew in our taproom…they may have other gigs in the city, and we support their efforts there too. Beer is beer. Drink it here. Drink it there. Drink it anywhere (with apologies to Dr. Seuss).","website":"http://groundswellbrew.com/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6ODyQZ/upload_ylP2by-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6ODyQZ/upload_ylP2by-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6ODyQZ/upload_ylP2by-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 16:46:02","updateDate":"2014-03-16 21:15:18","locations":[{"id":"0bgPa6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6304 Riverdale St.","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92120","phone":"(619) 820-0961","latitude":32.7890309,"longitude":-117.0997547,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 16:46:29","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"WRgdAj","name":"Hailstorm Brewing Co.","description":"Hailstorm Brewing Co. is a brewery located in Tinley Park, IL.

Middleton Brewing is family operated business, focusing community support, doing things right and supporting what we believe in.","website":"http://www.middletonbrewing.net","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:36:28","updateDate":"2014-07-25 13:36:28","locations":[{"id":"GPsxRB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"607 SE Everett Mall Way 27-A","locality":"Everett","region":"Washington","phone":"(425) 280-9178","website":"http://www.middletonbrewing.net","latitude":47.9103912,"longitude":-122.2249341,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:38:01","updateDate":"2014-07-25 13:38:01","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"lthkeP","name":"Mill Whistle Brewing","description":"Mill Whistle Brewing is a one barrel brewery focused on exceptional craft beers despite our lack of sophistication.

By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.\r\n\r\nAll of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013. Stop on by for a flight or a glass, hang out to enjoy our seasonal selections, and stay a while for a little South Dakota hospitality. \r\n\r\nJoin us in the Black Hills and discover your own pint of gold.","website":"http://www.minerbrewing.com/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nnJJi8/upload_dWT0zZ-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nnJJi8/upload_dWT0zZ-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nnJJi8/upload_dWT0zZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-22 17:42:07","updateDate":"2013-11-22 17:42:58","locations":[{"id":"2EpPvi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"23845 Hwy 385","locality":"Hill City","region":"South Dakota","postalCode":"57745","phone":"(605) 574-2886","website":"http://www.minerbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:00 am - 6:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 8:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 6:00 pm","latitude":43.948569,"longitude":-103.522307,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-22 17:42:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"tHii3J","name":"Prairie Berry Eastbank","streetAddress":"322 East 8th Street","locality":"Sioux Falls","region":"SD","postalCode":"57103","phone":"605-496-7175","website":"http://www.prairieberry.com/eastbank/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon.-Sat., 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Sun., 11 a.m.-4 p.m.","latitude":43.5486429,"longitude":-96.7238975,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"new_unverified","statusDisplay":"New, Unverified","createDate":"2014-11-17 21:32:03","updateDate":"2014-11-17 21:32:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"xwMmBD","name":"Miscreation Brewing Company","website":"http://www.miscreationbrewing.com/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xwMmBD/upload_yViKtu-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xwMmBD/upload_yViKtu-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xwMmBD/upload_yViKtu-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-15 20:15:42","updateDate":"2014-10-17 15:14:57","locations":[{"id":"nNmfkN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6 Center Square","locality":"Hanover","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17331","latitude":39.8007276,"longitude":-76.9833432,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-16 17:46:30","updateDate":"2014-10-16 17:46:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"A1ez0c","name":"Mississippi Brewing Company","description":"Mississippi Brewing Company LLC plans be pouring beer in late 2013.

This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear… We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped… FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can’t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things… Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we’ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it. Come by and visit, listen to some tunes, grab a pint, fill a growler, and join us on this adventure.","website":"http://ocelotbrewing.com/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qvbd2N/upload_umGWaC-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qvbd2N/upload_umGWaC-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qvbd2N/upload_umGWaC-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:01","updateDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:45","locations":[{"id":"oPxIne","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"23600 Overland Drive","extendedAddress":"#180","locality":"Sterling","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20166","phone":"(703) 474-3050","website":"http://ocelotbrewing.com/","latitude":38.960326,"longitude":-77.5030993,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"9DnW7Z","name":"Odd13 Brewing","description":"Odd13 is a brewery located at 301 East Simpson Street in old-town Lafayette, Colorado.

One Love Brewery has partnered up with The 7th Settlement Brewing Company to build and share a custom made 7-barrel brewery premise, located downtown Dover at 47 Washington Street. By forming this alliance, two very different brewers will be able to share the same brewing premises, equipment, overhead expenses and even marketing tools such as pint glasses and coasters.\r\n\r\nVeteran brewer Michael Snyder and partner Jennifer Riley, plan on having rotating styles of beers. Because of limited fermentation space at start up, both breweries will focus on ale style beers. Ales take about 3 weeks to produce, where as a lager can takes twice as long.\r\n\r\n“One Love means different things to different people.” Says Michael.\r\n“For us, it’s about the love of being connected with the outdoors and the positive experiences it provides for us. We are firm believers in creating our own life experience; we go after it, one day at a time. We try to keep everything local when every possible or feasible. We are in a very special, beautiful place, and we want to enjoy everything from the shore of the Atlantic to the summits of the Presidential Range. I have been brewing professionally for 17 years.

Within these unique and historic walls, we brew 20bbl batches of beer that sings with flavor and delights us. The yin/yang of our brewing philosophy is hoppy/sessionable and we aim to brew beers where “the first sip calls for the third”.  We’re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means “ghost of the Rhine”, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that’s our favorite kind.","website":"http://rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0s8yID/upload_aOpehU-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0s8yID/upload_aOpehU-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0s8yID/upload_aOpehU-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2014-10-02 15:38:58","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http://rhinegeist.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"lXWKH0","name":"Riff Raff Brewing","description":"Founded in 2013, Riff Raff Brewing Company opens in downtown Pagosa Springs, Colorado, in May 2013.

Peaceful country living, it feeds the soul, drink some in as you spend a little time with us. \r\n\r\nWe got busy, raised the little ones up, built a business and worked hard on the old homestead remembering to be grateful each day for the life we have carved out. What a long strange trip it has been so far! We have learned ambition and hard work get you where you want to go, it just takes some time and a lot of patience! \r\n\r\nAustin and I Started brewing several years ago, we loved cooking together and drinking too so it was a natural progression. Brewing and sharing with friends our fresh all grain brews became an obsession for us. Our passion is to brew great local beers by sourcing the finest quality ingredients available and creating craft recipes that highlight the best qualities of those ingredients.

Pitchers'","description":"When Wilson Barr and Tommy Hester met at Williams College in 2007, both were pitchers on the Varsity baseball team. However, they quickly realized their love of baseball was more than equaled by their love of a good drink. Despite the desolate landscape of college get-togethers where there was a strong emphasis on a drink's quantity over quality, Wilson and Tommy were able to find a shared interest in the craft beer industry. When they started an alcoholic beverage company, their adventurous attitudes translated into a desire to create a product that was truly new and exciting. The result was T.W. Pitchers’ Snake Bite®.\r\n\r\nWhile in college, Wilson lived in Europe and discovered that generations of British pub-goers have enjoyed blending lager and hard apple cider. He was astonished to learn the popular concoction had only sparingly made its way across the pond to the United States. Ready to undo this injustice, he returned from his trip and founded W.G. Barr Beverage Company. Tommy was brought on board, and the dynamic duo got to work bringing Snake Bite – a bottled blend of lager and cider - to the thirsty people of America. T.W. Pitchers’, which stands for \"Two Williams Pitchers’,\" or \"Tommy and Wilson, Pitchers,\" was immediately settled on as the brand name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of hard work and many late nights spent taste testing, Wilson and Tommy launched T.W. Pitchers’ Snake Bite in San Francisco. Armed with their Airstream office, a little bit of know-how, and a whole lot of gumption, Wilson and Tommy are committed to quenching your thirst, one bottle of Snake Bite at a time.

In the good ole’ days as a young pup, he could be found cruising the college campus at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, body surfin’ at Doggie Beach in Ocean Beach (San Diego), skiing down the snow capped mountains in Ruidoso, New Mexico, relaxing in the Hot Springs of Arkansas and finally making his home in the Valley of the Sun. Since Bear was an active dog and on the go, he wanted to create a place where he and his friends could “Come, Sit And Stay”.\r\n\r\n    Well Uncle Bears’ Brewhouse Grill is that place. Born out of Bear’s  love for craft beer and excellent food, we have created an upbeat, fun atmosphere where friends, family and co-workers can come to enjoy a variety of delicious menu selections & NOW our own locally brewed craft beer. The Uncle Bear’s Brewhouse opened in 2013, as well as the 4 Grill and Bar locations were re-branded to the Grill and Tap concept that same year.\r\n\r\nOn the menu, whenever you see Bear’s paw print  you can be assured the item is a long-term house favorite or a new favorite we are sure Bear would have loved. Try any one of the items from the “Famous” Sliders, Backyard Burgers and Birds, Big Plates and Serious Sizzles, Gourmet Pizza, Bear “Bites” or Wing selections and you are in for a true treat.    \r\n\r\nThe unique motif has been designed to resemble all of the places Bear or your family dog would hang out such as the garage, backyard or home.\r\n\r\n In addition to the excellent food menu, we feature fantastic house drinks and NOW a wonderful selection of craft beers brewed on site in our state of the art display brewery. Be sure to try a Flight Bone (5-4oz. tasters) or a Growler (64oz. take-home jug) or a pint of our craft beer. With all the goodies mentioned above and numerous sporting events on a slew of TV’s, we promise you will be treated to a “Doggone Good” experience compliments of our attentive, knowledgeable and enthusiastic team..","website":"http://ubbeer.com/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KFxWOH/upload_Bf1jM9-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KFxWOH/upload_Bf1jM9-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KFxWOH/upload_Bf1jM9-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-06 22:35:07","updateDate":"2014-06-09 11:25:03","locations":[{"id":"K420Iz","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"4921 E.

We are excited to finally bring our love of beer and commitment to quality to Livermore, the Tri-Valley, and beyond.\r\n\r\nOur story is one of two independent breweries, Mt. Diablo Brewing and Working Man Brewing Company, coming together to work on one common goal.  Both companies were founded by award-winning home brewers who have a passion to bring high quality, well crafted beer that is fresh and local.  A chance meeting brought these working men together; a shared vision now combines forces under one name, Working Man Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nThe company’s brewers have each have spent years working to perfect great beer recipes.  Beer geeks at heart, both will tinker and tweak the ingredients until the product is just right.  The main goal always being to make a beer they could be proud to share and proud to drink. We never let a beer go out the door that we don’t believe in.","website":"http://www.workingmanbrewing.com/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"http://beer.wickedcode.com/?page_id=641","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H8jawh/upload_zvrjZf-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H8jawh/upload_zvrjZf-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H8jawh/upload_zvrjZf-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-26 18:34:10","updateDate":"2013-07-27 14:01:18","locations":[{"id":"kDhJT9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5542 Brisa Street","extendedAddress":"Suite F","locality":"Livermore","region":"California","postalCode":"94550","phone":"(925) 269-9622","website":"http://www.workingmanbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday 4-7PM\r\nSaturday 12-6PM\r\nSunday 12-4PM","latitude":37.697526,"longitude":-121.725189,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-27 14:00:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"djyiuL","name":"Zephyr Brewing Co","description":"Brewery in development.
