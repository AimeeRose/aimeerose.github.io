Brothers Jason and Tom Sobocinski come from a Polish/Italian family where food and drink is always the focus of every gathering. From Jason’s wedding to his son’s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! \r\n\r\nBlack Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews. We hope you’ll enjoy Black Hog Brewing Company at one of our pig roasts soon or whatever occasion brings you together for great beer and food with friends and family.","website":"http://www.blackhogbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_wvB5LD-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_wvB5LD-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_wvB5LD-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-24 01:04:56","updateDate":"2014-09-23 14:18:17","locations":[{"id":"LoZU74","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"115 Hurley Rd","extendedAddress":"Bldg 9A","locality":"Oxford","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06478","website":"http://www.blackhogbrewing.com","latitude":41.4757707,"longitude":-73.1520822,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-24 01:04:56","updateDate":"2014-08-25 11:53:08","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"BdqPqo","name":"Black Hole Beer Company","description":"Our Taproom features a modern yet casual atmosphere where can enjoy a rotating selection of fine craft beer, wine, homemade sangria, whiskey, as well as some light fare.

It’s in the Wagner kitchen where Eric first combined his passion and talent for gourmet cooking with over 20 years of engineering expertise, specifically in treating water. Who knew that brewing delicious beer was so similar to the science of treating water? The process of releasing enzymes to break down starches into sugar and fermenting the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide is second nature to a water engineer, while balancing delicious flavor is what a gourmet cook strives for. Hence the “blueprint” for great beer was born! Eric’s unique combination of talents led the way for the one-of-a-kind, handcrafted beer, each as original as a fingerprint.\r\n\r\nBetter than a recipe, a brewing “blueprint” combines science and great culinary skill to create a Brüeprint.\r\n\r\nIt’s with this vision that we bring Apex its first handcrafted Brewery—Brüeprint Brewing Company. The Wagner family, that is Brüeprint, is dedicated to traditional social interaction while sampling delicious beer. Our hope is that you’ll rest your phone for a few minutes to have a real conversation, partake in or watch a game with friends, or take in a great band. Whatever your idea of connecting is, plan for a great time—grab a Brüeprint!","website":"http://brueprint.com/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/sUoofg/upload_9xt9Ap-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/sUoofg/upload_9xt9Ap-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/sUoofg/upload_9xt9Ap-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-17 15:03:07","updateDate":"2014-04-10 12:14:31","locations":[{"id":"CWwxeR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1229 Perry Road","locality":"Apex","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27502","website":"http://brueprint.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Wednesday - Saturday   4 - 10 PM","latitude":35.7121944,"longitude":-78.851764,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-17 15:03:42","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"2fXsvw","name":"Brutopia Brewery","description":"Here at Brutopia, we aim to provide world-class beers influenced by a traditional brewery style, while also tapping into the rich diversity of artisan craft beers and amazing local products found in our state of Rhode Island.

We never focus on pleasing just one style since we love just about all of them and while not every beer we brew will be the perfect student in its category it will be one that will get the craft beer loving palate craving more with each sip.","website":"http://chainreactionbrewingco.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/57GOSM/upload_OCI3uf-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/57GOSM/upload_OCI3uf-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/57GOSM/upload_OCI3uf-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-23 11:26:33","updateDate":"2014-06-23 11:26:34","locations":[{"id":"iYshKM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"902 S Lipan St","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80223","phone":"(303) 941-0732","website":"http://chainreactionbrewingco.com","latitude":39.6995433,"longitude":-105.0012001,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-23 11:27:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"8Uwsc3","name":"Chilly Water Brewing Co.","description":"An urban brewpub with super food infused with great music, located in Downtown Indianapolis.","website":"http://www.chillywaterbrewing.com/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8Uwsc3/upload_8jG0c9-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8Uwsc3/upload_8jG0c9-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8Uwsc3/upload_8jG0c9-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-06 19:08:03","updateDate":"2014-09-07 17:46:24","locations":[{"id":"oaDD5l","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"719 Virginia Ave","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46203","phone":"(317) 964-0518","website":"http://www.chillywaterbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.7572649,"longitude":-86.146124,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-07 17:45:47","updateDate":"2014-09-07 17:45:47","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"B5jTO7","name":"Clouds Brewing","description":"A locally owned and operated brew pub","website":"http://www.stormcloudsbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/B5jTO7/upload_iTcELH-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/B5jTO7/upload_iTcELH-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/B5jTO7/upload_iTcELH-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-06 13:38:27","updateDate":"2014-05-30 13:45:02","locations":[{"id":"c2Ifvu","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"126 N.

Tours will be offered once we are up and running so stay tuned for this.\r\n\r\nThe other 1/3 of the building will house the taproom and will be open to everyone. The taproom will be able to seat about 50 people at a time and will be the only place to purchase Recess beer. In the taproom, customers will be able to sit and enjoy a beer with some friends or they can take a growler home with them. Food will not be served but patrons are more than welcome to order from an outside source or bring their own food.\r\n\r\nA main focus at Recess will be the Community Supported Brewery program. This program will function similarly to community supported agriculture, in which consumers pay for weekly or monthly boxes of fresh-from-the-farm produce. Instead of produce, Recess will be providing fresh-from-the-brewery beer.

They first met in 2005 while going to the University of Minnesota for bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering. Over time, they all worked together as hardware design engineers for a small engineering services company specializing in RF-centric products. Being young engineers working downtown Minneapolis, they attended various happy hours together. It quickly became clear that they all really loved craft beer and were very intrigued with the science of the brewing process.\r\n\r\nJake and Jeff are the two brewers of the company who designed and honed the recipes. They got their start in 2006 brewing extract kits on Jake's Mom's kitchen stove much to her chagrin. (A few boil-overs did occur on her stove, whoops!) They brewed countless extract kits until in 2010, when after touring Surly and Flat Earth, they were inspired to turn their passion (like the founders of those breweries) into a business. From that point forward it has been all grain brewing and loving it. Nowadays, Jake focuses on the brewing aspect of the business while Jeff focuses on the brewing as well as the business side of the operation.\r\n\r\nGeorge, in the early years, was a force within the brewery by helping out at every brew session and providing needed muscle for cleaning and moving material around the brewhouse. He focused a lot on the quality of our beer and pushed us to design better more complex beers. He has moved on to be in charge of our online presence including developing our own beer wiki engine.","website":"http://twbrewing.com/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HhKKA6/upload_Oo4Qmh-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HhKKA6/upload_Oo4Qmh-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HhKKA6/upload_Oo4Qmh-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 14:09:11","locations":[{"id":"06ughl","name":"Tin Whiskers Brewery and Taproom","streetAddress":"125 E 9th St.","extendedAddress":"Unit 127","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55101","phone":"(651) 330-4734","website":"http://twbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Wednesday: 4-10PM\r\nThursday 4-10PM\r\nFriday 3-11PM\r\nSaturday 12-11PM","latitude":44.9506615,"longitude":-93.09361,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"4c0spJ","name":"Tonopah Brewing Co","website":"http://www.tonopahbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-10 13:10:41","updateDate":"2014-07-10 13:10:41","locations":[{"id":"BKWQJ3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"315 Main Street","locality":"Tonopah","region":"Nevada","postalCode":"89049","phone":"(775) 482-2000","website":"http://www.tonopahbrewing.com/","latitude":38.0710516,"longitude":-117.2331562,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-10 13:11:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"XGG8LX","name":"Top Rung Brewing Company","description":"Top Rung Brewing is a 10 barrel production brewery with tasting room at the brewery.
